The taxation of trade routes to\\noutlaying star systems is in dispute.\\nHoping to resolve the matter with a blockade of deadly battleships, the\\ngreedy Trade Federation has stopped all shipping to the small planet of\\nNaboo.\\nWhile the congress of the Republic endlessly debates this alarming chain of\\nevents, the Supreme Chancellor has secretly dispatched two Jedi Knights,\\nthe guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy, to settle the\\nconflict.....\\n\\nPAN DOWN to reveal a small space cruiser heading TOWARD CAMERA at great\\nspeed.

Out the cockpit window, the sinister battleship\\nlooms ever closer.\\n\\nEXT.

FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - DOCKING BAY - SPACE\\n\\nA PROTOCOL DROID, TC-14, waits at the door to the docking bay. Two WORKER\\nDROIDS, PK-4 and EG-9 watch.\\n\\nPK-4 : They must be important if the Viceroy sent one of those useless\\nprotocol gearheads to greet them.\\n\\nThe door opens, and the Republic cruiser can be seen in the docking bay.\\nTwo darkly robed figures are greeted by TC-14.\\n\\nTC-14 : I\\'m TC-14 at your service.

My master\\nwill be with you shortly.\\n\\nThe droid bows before OBI-WAN KENOBI and QUI- GON JINN. He backs out the\\ndoor and it closes. The JEDI lower their hoods and look out a large window\\nat the lush green planet of Naboo. QUI-GON sixty years old, has long white\\nhair in a ponytail. He is tall and striking, with blue eyes. OBI-WAN is\\ntwenty five, with very short brown hair, pale skin, and blue eyes. Several\\nexotic, bird-like creatures SING in a cage near the door.\\n\\nOBI-WAN : I have a bad feeling about this.\\nQUI-GON : I don\\'t sense anything.\\nOBI-WAN : It\\'s not about the mission, Master, it\\'s\\nsomethging...elsewhere...elusive.\\nQUI-GON : Don\\'t center on your anxiety, Obi-Wan. Keep your concentration\\nhere and now where it belongs.\\nOBI-WAN : Master Yoda says I should be mindful of the future...\\nQUI-GON : .....but not at the expense of the moment.

FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY\\n\\nA hologram of NUTE , surrounded by BATTLE DROIDS, appears in the conference\\nroom hallway.\\n\\nNUTE : They must be dead by now. Blast, what\\'s left of them.\\n\\nThe hologram fades off, as a BATTLE DROID, OWO-1, cautiously opens the\\ndoor. A deadly green cloud billows from the room. BATTLE DROIDS cock their\\nweapons as a figure stumbles out of the smoke. It is TC-14 , carrying the\\ntray of drinks.\\n\\nTC14 : Oh, excuse me, so sorry.\\n\\nThe PROTOCOL DROID passes the armed camp just as two flashing laser swords\\nfly out of the deadly fog, cutting down several BATTLE DROIDS before they\\ncan fire.\\n\\nINT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE\\n\\nThe bridge is a cocophony of alarms. NUTE and RUNE watch OWO-1 on the\\nviewscreen.\\n\\nOWO-1 : Not sure exactly what...\\n\\nOWO-1 is suddenly cut in half in mid-sentence. RUNE gives NUTE a worried\\nlook.\\n\\nNUTE : What in blazes is going on down there?\\nRUNE : Have you ever encountered a Jedi Knight before, sir?\\nNUTE : Well, not exactly, but I don\\'t...(panicked) Seal off the bridge.\\nRUNE : That won\\'t be enough, sir.\\n\\nThe doors to the bridge SLAM shut.\\n\\nNUTE : I want destroyer droids up here at once!!!\\nRUNE : We will not survive this.\\n\\nINT.

FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE\\n\\nThe CREW is very nervous as sparks start flying around the bridge door.\\nQUI-GON and OBI-WAN are on the view screen.\\n\\nNUTE : Close the blast doors!!!\\n\\nThe huge, very thick blast door slams shut, followed by a second door, then\\na third. There is a hissing sound as the huge doors seal shut. QUI-GON tabs\\nthe door with his sword. The screen goes black as a red spot appears in the\\ncenter of the blast door.\\n\\nRUNE : ...They\\'re still coming through!\\n\\nOn the door, chunks of molten metal begin to drop away.\\n\\nNUTE : Impossible!! This is impossible!!\\nRUNE : Where are those destroyer droids?!\\n\\nINT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY - OUTSIDE BRIDGE\\n\\nTen ugly destroyer WHEEL DROIDS roll down the hallway at full speed. Just\\nbefore they get to the bridge area, they stop and transform into their\\nbattle configuration. QUI-GON can\\'t see them but senses their presence.\\n\\nQUI-GON : Destroyer droids!\\nOBI-WAN : Offhand, I\\'d say this mission is past the negotiaion stage.\\n\\nThe WHEEL DROIDS, led by P-59, rush the entry area from three hallways,\\nblasting away with their laser guns. They stop firing and stand in a\\nsemi-circle as the smoke clears. OBI-WAN and QUI-GON are nowhere to be\\nseen.\\n\\nP-59 : Switch to bio...There they are!\\n\\nThe Jedi materialize at the far end of the hallway and dash through the\\ndoorway that slams shut. The WHEEL DROIDS blast away at the two JEDI with\\ntheir laser swords.\\n\\nOBI-WAN : They have shield generators!\\nQUI-GON : It\\'s a standoff! Let\\'s go!\\n\\nINT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE\\n\\nNUTE and RUNE stand on the bridge, watching the view screen as the WHEEL\\nDROIDS\\' POV speeds to the doorway.\\n\\nRUNE : We have them on the run, sir...they\\'re no match for destroyer\\ndroids.\\nTEY HOW : Sir, they\\'ve gone up the ventilation shaft.\\n\\nINT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - MAIN BAY\\n\\nQUI-GON and OBI-WAN appear at a large vent in a giant hanger bay. They are\\ncareful not to be seen. Thousands of BATTLE DROIDS are loading onto landing\\ncraft.\\n\\nQUI-GON : Battle droids.\\nOBI-WAN : It\\'s an invisible army.\\nQUI-GON : It\\'s an odd play for the Trade Federation. We\\'ve got to warn the\\nNaboo and contact Chancellor Valorum. Let\\'s split up. Stow aboard separate\\nships and meet down on the planet.\\nOBI-WAN : You were right about one thing, Master. The negotiations were\\nshort.\\n\\nINT.

Wearing her\\nelaborate headdress and robes, she sits, surrounded by the GOVERNING\\nCOUNCIL and FOUR HANDMAIDENS, EIRTAE, YANE, RABE, and SACHE.\\n\\nNUTE : (cont\\'d) Again you come before me, Your highness. The Federation is\\npleased.\\nAMIDALA : You will not be pleased when you hear what I have to say,\\nViceroy...Your trade boycott of our planet has ended.\\n\\nNUTE smirks at RUNE.\\n\\nNUTE : I was not aware of such a failure.\\nAMIDALA : I have word that the Senate is finally voting on this blockade of\\nyours.\\nNUTE : I take it you know the outcome. I wonder why they bother to vote.\\nAMIDALA : Enough of this pretense, Viceroy! I\\'m aware the Chancellor\\'s\\nAmbassadors are with you now, and that you have beencommanded to reach a\\nsettlement.\\nNUTE : I know nothing about any Ambassadors...you must be mistaken.\\n\\nAMIDALA, surprised at his reaction, studies him carefully.\\n\\nAMIDALA : Beware, Viceroy....the Federation is going too far this time.\\nNUTE : Your Highness, we would never do anything without the approval of\\nthe Senate. You assume too much.\\nAMIDALA : We will see.\\n\\nThe QUEEN fades off, and the view screen goes black.\\n\\nRUNE : She\\'s right, the Senate will never....\\nNUTE : It\\'s too late now.\\nRUNE : Do you think she suspects an attack?\\nNUTE : I don\\'t know, but we must move quickly to disrupt all communications\\ndown there.\\n\\nINT. NABOO PALACE - THRONE ROOM\\n\\nThe QUEEN, EIRTAE, SACHE and her Governor, SIO BIBBLE, stand before a\\nhologram of SENATOR PALPATINE, a thin, kindly man.\\n\\nPALPATINE : ...How could that be true? I have assurances from the\\nChancellor...his Ambassaodrs did arrive. It must be\\nthe...get...negotiate...\\n\\nThe hologram of PALPATIONE sputters and fades away.\\n\\nAMIDALA : Senator Palpatine?!? (turns to Panaka) What\\'s happening?\\n\\nCAPTAIN PANAKA turns to his SARGEANT\\n\\nCAPT. PANAKA : Check the transmission generators...\\nBIBBLE : A malfunction?\\nCAPT. PANAKA : It could be the Federation jamming us. Your Highness.\\nBIBBLE : A communications disruption can only mean one thing. Invasion.\\nAMIDALA : Don\\'t jump to conclusions, Governor. The Federation would not\\ndare go that far.\\nCAPT. PANAKA : The Senate would revoke their trade franchise, and they\\'d be\\nfinished.\\nAMIDALA : We must continue to rely on negotiation.\\nBIBBLE : Negotiation? We\\'ve lost all communications!...and where atre the\\nChancellors Ambassadors? How can we negotiate? We must prepare to defend\\nourselves.\\nCAPT. PANAKA : This is a dangerous situation, Your Highness. Our security\\nvolunteers will be no match against a battle-hardened Federation army.\\nAMIDALA : I will not condone a course of action that will lead us to war.\\n\\nEXT. SPACE LANDING CRAFT - TWILIGHT (FX)\\n\\nSix landing craft fly in formation toward the surface of the planet Naboo.\\n\\nEXT. NABOO SWAMP - SHALLOW LAKE - TWILIGHT\\n\\nThree landing craft slowly descend through the cloud cover of the\\nperpetually gray twilight side of the planet. One by one, the Federation\\nwarships land in the eerie swamp.\\nOBI-WAN\\'s head emerges from the mud of a shallow lake. For in the\\nbackground, the activities of the invasion force can be seen in the mist.\\nOBI-WAN takes several deep breaths, then dissapears again under the muddy\\nswamp. Troop Transports (MTT\\'s) emerge from the landing craft.\\n\\nEXT. NABOO EDGE OF SWAMP / GRASS PLAINS - TWILIGHT (FX)\\n\\nThe droid invasion force moves out of the swamp and onto a grassy plain.\\nOOM-9, in his tank, looks out over the vast ARMY marching across the\\nrolling hills.

We are meeting no resistance.\\nNUTE : Excellent.\\n\\nEXT. NABOO SWAMP - TWILIGHT\\n\\nQUI-GON runs through the strange landscape, glancing back to see the\\nmonstrous troop transports, emerging from the mist. Animals begin to run\\npast him in a panic.\\nAn odd, frog-like Gungan, JAR JAR INKS, squats holding a clam he has\\nretrieved from the murky swamp. The shell pops open. JAR JAR\\'s greta tongue\\nsnaps out and grabs the clam, swallowing it in one gulp.\\nJAR JAR looks up and sees QUI-GON and the other creatures running like the\\nwind toward him. One of the huge MTT\\'s bears down on the JEDI like a\\ncharging locomotive. JAR JAR stands transfixed, still holding the clam\\nshell in one hand.\\n\\nJAR JAR : Oh, noooooooooo!\\n\\nJAR JAR drops the shell and grabs onto QUI-GON as he passes. The JEDI is\\ncaught by surprise.\\n\\nJAR JAR : (Cont\\'d) Hey, help me! Help me!!\\nQUI-GON : Let go!\\n\\nThe machine is about tp crush them as QUI-GON drags JAR JAR behind him.\\nJust as the transport is about to hit them, QUI-GON drops, and JAR JAR goes\\nsplat into the mud with him. The transport races overhead.\\nQUI-GON and JAR JAR pull themselves out of the mud. They stand watching the\\nwar machine dissapear into the mist. JAR JAR grabs QUI-GON and hugs him.\\n\\nJAR JAR : Oyi, mooie-mooie! I luv yous!\\n\\nThe frog-like creature kisses the JEDI.\\n\\nQUI-GON : Are you brainless? You almost got us killed!\\nJAR JAR : I spake.\\nQUI-GON : The ability to speak does not make you intelligent.

Weesa ganna....\\n\\nQUI-GON throws JAR JAR into the mud.\\n\\nQUI-GON : Stay down!\\n\\nHis head pops up.\\n\\nJAR JAR : ...dieeee!\\n\\nThe two troops fire laser bolts at OBI-WAN. QUI-GON deflects the bolts\\nback, and the STAPS blow up. One-two. OBI-WAN is exhausted and tries to\\ncatch his breath.\\n\\nOBI-WAN : Sorry, Master, the water fried my weapon.\\n\\nOBI-WAN pulls out his burnt laser sword handle. QUI-GON inspects it, as JAR\\nJAR pulls himself out of the mud.\\n\\nQUI-GON : You forgot to turn your power off again, didn\\'t you?\\n\\nOBI-WAN nods sheeplishly.\\n\\nQUI-GON : (cont\\'d) It won\\'t take long to recharge, but this is a lesson I\\nhope you\\'ve learned, my young Padawan.\\nOBI-WAN : Yes, Master.\\nJAR JAR : Yousa sav-ed my again, hey?\\nOBI-WAN : What\\'s this?\\nQUI-GON : A local.

Terrible tings if my\\ngoen back dare.\\n\\nA PULSATING SOUND is heard in the distance.\\n\\nQUI-GON : You hear that?\\n\\nJAR JAR shakes his head yes.\\n\\nQUI-GON : (cont\\'d) That\\'s the sound of a thousand terrible things heading\\nthis way...\\nOBI-WAN : When they find us, they will crush us, grind us into little\\npieces, then blast us into oblivion!\\nJAR JAR : Oh! Yousa point is well seen. Dis way! Hurry!\\n\\nJAR JAR turns and runs into the swamp.\\n\\nEXT. NABOO SWAMP LAKE - TWILIGHT\\n\\nQUI-GON, OBI-WAN and JAR JAR run into a murky lake and stop as JAR JAR\\ntries to catch his breath. The TRANSPORTS ARE HEARD in the distance.\\n\\nQUI-GON : Much farther?\\nJAR JAR : Wesa goen underwater, okeyday?\\n\\nQUI-GON and OBI-WAN pull out small capsule from their utility belts that\\nturn into breathing masks.\\n\\nJAR JAR : (cont\\'d) My warning yous.

NABOO LAKE - UNDERWATER\\n\\nQUI-GON and OBI-WAN swim behind JAR JAR, who is very much at home in the\\nwater. Down they swim into murky depths. In the distance the glow of Otoh\\nGunga, an underwater city made up of large bubbles, becomes more distinct.\\nThey approach the strange, art nouveau habitat. JAR JAR swims magically\\nthrough one of the bubble membranes, which seals behind him. OBI-WAN and\\nQUI-GON follow.\\n\\nINT. OTOH GUNGA - CITY SQUARE\\n\\nGUNGANS in the square scatter when they see the strange JEDI. Four GUARDS\\narmed with long electro-poles ride two-legged KAADUS into the square.

NABOO LAKE - UNDERWATER - SUB (FX)\\n\\nThe little sub continue to propel itself toward the surface, which is\\nbrightly lit.\\n\\nJAR JAR : Wesa dude it!\\n\\nEXT. THEED - ESTUARY - DAY\\n\\nParadise. Billowing clouds frame a romantic body of water. There is a LOUD\\nRUSH OF BUBBLES, and a small sub bobs to the surface.\\nThe current in the estuary begins to pull the sub backward into a fast\\nmoving river. OBI-WAN switches off the two remaining bubble canopies.\\nQUI-GON stands up to look around. JAR JAR lets out a sigh of relief.\\n\\nJAR JAR : Wesa safe now.\\nQUI-GON : Get this thing started.\\nJAR JAR : Dissen berry good. Hey?\\nOBI-WAN : What is it?\\n\\nJAR JAR looks back to where they\\'re drifting. He sees they are headed for a\\nhuge waterfall.\\n\\nJAR JAR : What!!?? Oie boie!\\n\\nOBI-WAN tries to start the engine. The long props behind the sub slowly\\nbegin to rotate. OBI-WAN struggles until finally, a few feet short of the\\nwaterfall, the sub starts and is able to generate enough power to stop\\ndrifting backward in the powerful current. The sub slowly moves forward. In\\nthe background, QUI-GON takes a cable out of his belt. The engine coughs\\nand dies. They start drifting backward again. JAR JAR panics.\\n\\nJAR JAR : (cont\\'d) Iyiiyi, wesa die\\'n here, hey!\\n\\nQUI-GON shoots the thin cable, and it wraps itself around a railing on the\\nshore. The sub pulls the cable taut, and the little craft hangs\\nprecariously over the edge of the waterfall.\\n\\nQUI-GON : Come on...\\n\\nOBI-WAN climbs out of the sub and pulls himself along the cable. QUI-GON\\nstarts in after him.\\n\\nQUI-GON : (cont\\'d) Come on, Jar Jar.\\nJAR JAR : No! Too scary!\\nOBI-WAN : Get up here!\\nJAR JAR : No a mighty no!\\n\\nJAR JAR looks back and sees he is hanging over the waterfall.\\n\\nJAR JAR : (cont\\'d) Oie boie...mesa comen.

OBI-WAN is on shore and helps to\\npull QUI-GON out of the water.\\n\\nOBI-WAN : That was close.\\nBATTLE DROID 3B3 : (O.S) Drop your weapons!\\n\\nThe TWO JEDI turn around to see a BATTLE DROID standing in front of them.\\nJAR JAR climbs up on shore between the JEDI.\\n\\nBATTLE DROID 3B3 : I said drop your weapons\\n\\nQUI-GON ignites his laser sword, and in a brief flash, the DROID is cut\\ndown by the JEDI. A stray laser bolt hits the cable and the sub breaks\\nlose, crashing down the waterfall.\\nThe JEDI move on. JAR JAR reluctantly follows and looks back at the mess.\\n\\nJAR JAR : Whoa!!!\\n\\nEXT. THEED - PALACE - DAY\\n\\nThe waterfalls of Theed sparkle in the noonday sun.\\n\\nINT. THEED - PALACE THRONE ROOM - DAY\\n\\nQUEEN AMIDALA, SIO BIBBLE, and FIVE OF HER HANDMAIDENS (EIRTAE, YANE,\\nPADME, RABE, SACHE) are surrounded by TWENTY DROIDS. CAPTAIN PANAKA and\\nFOUR NABOO GUARDS are also held at gunpoint. NUTE and RUNE stand in the\\nmiddle of the room.\\n\\nBIBBLE : ...how will you explain this invasion to the Senate?\\nNUTE : The Naboo and the Federation will forge a treaty that will\\nlegitimize our occupation here. I\\'ve been assured it will be ratified by\\nthe Senate.\\nAMIDALA : I will not co-operate.\\nNUTE : Now, now, your Highness. You are not going to like what we have in\\nstore for your people. In time, their suffering will persuade you to see\\nour point of view. Commander. (OOM-9 steps forward) Process them.\\nOOM-9 : Yes, sir!

Unbeknownst to them, QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, and JAR JAR sneak\\nacross on a walkway above the plaza and jump from a balcony to begin an\\nattack to rescue the QUEEN.\\n\\nFOUR BATTLE DROIDS are instantly cut down. MORE DROIDS move forward and are\\nalso cut down by the JEDIS\\' flashing lightsabres until there is only the\\nDROID SERGEANT left. The SERGEANT starts to run but is pulled back to\\nQUI-GON by the Force, until finally he is dispatched by the JEDI.\\n\\nJAR JAR : Yousa guys bombad!\\n\\nQUEEN AMIDALA and the OTHERS are amazed. JAR JAR is getting used to this.\\nThey move between two buildings.\\n\\nQUI-GON : Your Highness, we are the Ambassadors, for the Supreme\\nChancellor.\\nBIBBLE : Your negotiations seem to have failed, Ambassador.\\nQUI-GON : The negotiations never took place.

ALARMS can be heard in the distance.\\n\\nCAPT. PANAKA : There are too many of them.\\nQUI-GON : That won\\'t be a problem. (to Amidala) Your Highness, under the\\ncircumstances, Isuggest you come to Coruscant with us.\\nAMIDALA : Thank you, Ambassador, but my place is here with my people.\\nQUI-GON : They will kill you if you stay.\\nBIBBLE : They wouldn\\'t dare.\\nCAPT. PANAKA : They need her to sign a treaty to make this invasion of\\ntheirs legal. They can\\'t afford to kill her.\\nQUI-GON : The situation here is not what it seems. There is something else\\nbehind all this, Your Highness. There is no logic in the Federation\\'s move\\nhere. My feelings tell me they will destroy you.\\nBIBBLE : Please, Your Highness, reconsider. Our only hope is for the Senate\\nto side with us... Senator Palpatine will need your help.\\nCAPT. PANAKA : Getting past their blockade is impossible, Your Highness.\\nAny attempt to escape will be dangerous.\\nBIBBLE : Your Highness, I will stay here and do what I can...They will have\\nto retain the Council of Governors in order to maintain control. But you\\nmust leave...\\n\\nThe QUEEN turns to PADME and EIRTAE.\\n\\nAMIDALA : Either choice presents a great risk...to all of us...\\nPADME : We are brave, Your Highness.\\nQUI-GON : If you are to leave, Your Highness, it must be now.\\nAMIDALA : Then, I will plead our case before the Senate. (to Bibble) Be\\ncareful, Governor.\\n\\nINT. CENTRAL HANGER - DAY\\n\\nThe door opens to the main hanger.

OTHER GUARDS run to their aid. OBI-WAN attacks the\\nGUARDS around the PILOTS. QUI-GON stands, fighting off DROIDS as the OTHERS\\nrush on board the spacecraft. OBI-WAN, the FREED PILOTS (including RIC\\nOLIE), GUARDS and GROUND CREW MEMBERS rush on board the ship. The OTHER\\nPILOTS and GUARDS race to SIO BIBBLR.

NABOO SPACECRAFT - DROID HOLD\\n\\nJAR JAR is led into a low, cramped doorway by OBI-WAN.\\n\\nOBI-WAN : Now stay here, and keep out of trouble.\\n\\nOBI-WAN closes the door. JAR JAR looks around and sees a long row of five\\nshort, dome-topped ASTRO DROIDS (R-2 units). The all look alike, except for\\nthier paint color, and they all seem to be shut down.\\n\\nJAR JAR : Ello, boyos. (no response) Disa wanna longo trip...hey?\\n\\nJAR JAR taps a bright red R-2 UNIT on the head, and its head pops up a bit.\\nHe lets out a gasp as he lifts the head.\\n\\nJAR JAR : (Cont\\'d) Tis opens?...Oooops! Many springs and things come flying\\nout.\\n\\nJAR JAR quickly closes it again, very embarrassed.\\n\\nJAR JAR : (Cont\\'d) Yoi! Just yoken!\\nRIC OLIE : Powers back! That little droid did it. He bypassed the main\\npower drive. Deflector shield up, at maximum.\\n\\nThe lone BLUE DROID finishes his repairs and goes back into the ship. The\\nNaboo spacecraft races away from the Federation battleship.\\n\\nRIC OLIE : There\\'s not enough power to get us to Coruscant...the hyperdrive\\nis leaking.\\nQUI-GON : We\\'ll have to land somewhere to refuel and repair the ship.\\n\\nQUI-GON studies a star chart on a monitor.\\n\\nOBI-WAN : Here, Master.

PANAKA : The Hutts??\\nOBI-WAN : It\\'s risky...but there\\'s no alternative.\\nCAPT. PANAKA : You can\\'t take Her Royal Highness there! The Hutts are\\ngangsters... If they discovered her...\\nQUI-GON : ...It would be no different than if we landed on a system\\ncontrolled by the Federation...except the Hutts aren\\'t looking for her,\\nwhich gives us an advantage.\\n\\nCPATAIN PANAKA takes a deep breath in frustration.\\n\\nEXT.

There we will\\nbe able to make needed repairs, then travel on to Coruscant.\\nCAPTAIN PANAKA : Your Highness, Tatooine is very dangerous. It\\'s controlled\\nby an alliance of gangs called the Hutts. I do not agree with the Jedi on\\nthis.\\nQUI-GON : You must trust my judgement, Your Highness.\\n\\nAMIDALA and PADME exchange looks.

The vendor suddenly\\nappears.\\n\\nVENDOR : Hey, that will be seven truguts!!\\n\\nJAR JAR opens his mouth in surprise, and the frog snaps away, ricochets\\naround the market, and lands in Sebulba\\'s soup, splashing him.

Very fast, very dangerous.\\nANAKIN : I\\'m the only human who can do it.\\n\\nSHMI looks askance at her son.\\n\\nANAKIN : (Cont\\'d) Mom, what? I\\'m not bragging. It\\'s true. Watto says he\\'s\\nnever heard of a human doing it.\\nQUI-GON : You must have Jedi reflexes if you race Pods.\\n\\nANAKIN smiles. JAR JAR attempts to snare another bit of food from the bowl\\nwith his tongue, but QUI-GON, in a flash, grabs it between his thumb and\\nforefinger. JAR JAR is startled.\\n\\nQUI-GON : (Cont\\'d) Don\\'t do that again.\\n\\nJAR JAR tries to acknowledge with some silly mumbling. QUI-GON lets go of\\nthe tongue, and it snaps back into JAR JAR\\'s mouth.\\n\\nANAKIN : I...I was wondering...something...\\nQUI-GON : What?\\nANAKIN : Well, ahhh...you\\'re a Jedi Knight, aren\\'t you?\\nQUI-GON : What makes you think that?\\nANAKIN : I saw your laser sword. Only Jedi carry that kind of weapon.\\n\\nQUI-GON leans back and slowly smiles.\\n\\nQUI-GON : Perhaps I killed a Jedi and stole it from him.\\nANAKIN : I don\\'t think so... No one can kill a Jedi Knight.\\nQUI-GON : I wish that were so...\\nANAKIN. I had a dream I was a Jedi. I came back here and freed all the\\nslaves...have you come to free us?\\nQUI-GON : No, I\\'m afraid not...\\nANAKIN : I think you have...why else would you be here?\\n\\nQUI-GON thinks for a moment.\\n\\nQUI-GON : I can see there\\'s no fooling you...(leans forward) You mustn\\'t\\nlet anyone know about us...we\\'re on our way to Coruscant, the central\\nsystem in the Republic, on a very important mission, and it must be kept\\nsecret.\\nANAKIN : Coruscant...wow...how did you end up here in the outer rim?\\nPADME : Our ship was damaged, and we\\'re stranded here until we can repair\\nit.\\nANAKIN : I can help!

It\\'s the fastest ever...There\\'s a big race\\ntomorrow, on Boonta Eve. You could enter my pod. It\\'s all but finished...\\nSHMI : Anakin, settle down. Watto won\\'t let you...\\nANAKIN : Watto doesn\\'t know I\\'ve built it. (to Qui-Gon) You could make him\\nthink it\\'s your\\'s, and you could get him to let me pilot it for you.\\n\\nQUI-GON looks to SHMI. She is upset.\\n\\nSHMI : I don\\'t want you to race, Annie...It\\'s awful. I die every time Watto\\nmakes you do it.\\n\\nANAKIN : But Mom, I love it...and they need help...they\\'re in trouble. The\\nprize money would more than pay for the parts they need. JAR JAR : Wesa ina\\npitty bad goo.\\nGUI-GON : Your mother\\'s right. Is there anyone friendly to the Republic who\\nmight be able to help us?\\n\\nSHMI shakes her head no.\\n\\nANAKIN : We have to help them, Mom...you said that the biggest problem in\\nthe universe is no one helps each other...\\nSHMI : Anakin, don\\'t...\\n\\nJAR JAR belches.

How can you do this? Not on Republic credits, I think. (he laughs)\\nQUI-GON : My ship will be the entry fee.\\n\\nQUI-GON pulls a small object that looks like a watch out of his pocket, and\\na hologram of the Naboo spacecraft appears about a foot long in front of\\nWATTO. He studies it.\\n\\nWATTO : Not bad...not bad...a Nubian.\\nQUI-GON : It\\'s in good order, except for the parts we need.\\nWATTO : ...but what would the boy ride? He smashed up my Pod in the last\\nrace. It will take some time to fix it.\\n\\nANAKIN is embarrassed and steps forward.\\n\\nANAKIN : Ahhhh....it wasn\\'t my fault really...Sebulba flashed me with his\\nvent ports. I actually saved the Pod...mostly.\\nWATTO : (laughing) That you did. The boy is good, no doubts there.\\nQUI-GON : I have...acquired a Pod in a game of chance. \"The fastest ever\\nbuilt.\"\\nWATTO : I hope you didn\\'t kill anyone I know for it. (laughs) So, you\\nsupply the Pod and the entry fee; I supply the boy. We split the winnings\\nfifty-fifty, I think.\\nQUI-GON : Fifty-fifty!?! If it\\'s going to be fifty-fifty, I suggest you\\nfront the cash for the entry. If we win, you keep all the winnings, minus\\nthe cost of the parts I need...If we lose, you keep my ship.\\n\\nWATTO thinks about this. ANAKIN tries not to be nervous.\\n\\nQUI-GON : (Cont\\'d) Either way, you win.\\nWATTO : (subtitled) Deal! Yo bana pee ho-tah, meedee ya. (Your friend is a\\nfollish one, methinks.)\\n\\nEXT.

He gives without any thought of\\nreward.\\nSHMI : He knows nothing of greed. He has...\\nQUI-GON : He has special powers.\\nSHMI : Yes...\\nQUI-GON : He can see things before they happen. That\\'s why he appears to\\nhave such quick reflexes. It is a Jedi trait.\\nSHMI : He deserves better than a slave\\'s life.\\nQUI-GON : The Force is unusally strong with him, that much is clear. Who\\nwas his father?\\nSHMI : There was no father, that I know of...I carried him, I gave him\\nbirth...I can\\'t explain what happened. Can you help him?\\nQUI-GON : I\\'m afraid not. Had he been born in the Republic, we would have\\nidentified him early, and he would have become Jedi, no doubt...he has the\\nway. But it\\'s too late for him now, he\\'s too old.\\n\\nEXT.

Stay away from those energy binders...\\nJAR JAR : Who, mesa?\\nANAKIN : If your hand gets caught in that beam, it will go numb for hours.\\n\\nJAR JAR peeks at the energy plate; it makes a little electronic pop, zaps\\nhim in the mouth and jumps back.

What a move!\\n\\nSEBULBA is furious. He stay\\'s right on Anakin\\'s tail, crowding him and\\npushing him through the turns.\\nSEBULBA pushes ANAKIN harder, and the young boy has a difficult time\\nkeeping control.

While he is\\ntrying to accomplish this maneuver, SEBULBA races past him.\\nANAKIN tries to get around SEBULBA, to no avail. Every move ANAKIN makes,\\nSEBULBA is able to block.\\nFinally, ANAKIN fakes a move into the inside as he usually does, then tries\\nto go around SEBULBA on the outside.

Suddenly, ANAKIN\\'s steering arm breaks, and his Pos starts\\nspinning.\\nThe release of tension sends SEBULBA into an ancient statue. One engine\\nEXPLODES, then the other. SEBULBA skids through the fire-balls, blackened,\\nbut unhurt. He slides to a smoking stop, gets out of his racer, and throws\\nwhat\\'s left of a shifter arm on the ground.

A few hundred police and guards\\nhave formed an underground movement. I brought as many of the keaders as I\\ncould. The Federation Army\\'s also much larger than we thought, and much\\nstronger. Your Highness, this is a battle I do not think we can win.\\nPADME : The battle is a diversion. The Gungans must draw theDroid Army away\\nfrom the cities.

ANAKIN watches with\\ninterest, as does ARTOO.\\n\\nPADME : We have a plan which should immobilize the Droid Army. We will send\\nwhat pilots we have to knock out the Droid control ship which is orbiting\\nthe planet. If we can get past their rayshields, we can sever communication\\nand their droids will be helpless.\\nQUI-GON : A well-conceived plan. However, there\\'s great risk. The weapons\\non your fighters may not penetrate the shields on the control ship.\\nOBI-WAN : And there\\'s an even bigger danger. If the Vicroy escapes, Your\\nHighness, he will return with another droid army.\\nPADME : That is why we must not fail to get to the Viceroy. Everything\\ndepends on it.\\n\\nINT.

It appears to be made up of primitives. We do\\nnot expect much resistance.\\nOOM-9 : I am increasing security at all Naboo detention camps.\\nDARTH MAUL : I feel there is more to this, My Master. The two Jedi may be\\nusing the Queen for their own purposes.\\nDARTH SIDIOUS : The Jedi cannot become involved. They can only protect the\\nQueen. Even Qui-Gon Jinn will not break that conenant.... This will work to\\nour advantage...\\nNUTE : I have your approval to proceed then, My Lord.\\nDARTH SIDIOUS : Proceed. Wipe them put...all of them. INT.

The taxation of trade routes to\\noutlaying star systems is in dispute.\\nHoping to resolve the matter with a blockade of deadly battleships, the\\ngreedy Trade Federation has stopped all shipping to the small planet of\\nNaboo.\\nWhile the congress of the Republic endlessly debates this alarming chain of\\nevents, the Supreme Chancellor has secretly dispatched two Jedi Knights,\\nthe guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy, to settle the\\nconflict.....\\n\\nPAN DOWN to reveal a small space cruiser heading TOWARD CAMERA at great\\nspeed. PAN with the cruiser as it heads towardthe beautiful green planet of\\nNaboo, which is surrounded by hundreds of Trade Federation battleships.\\n\\nINT. REPUBLIC CRUISER - COCKPIT\\n\\nIn the cockpit of the cruise, the CAPTAIN and PILOT maneuver closer to one\\nof the battleships.\\n\\nQUI-GON : (off screen voice) Captain.\\n\\nThe Captain turns to an unseen figure sitting behind her.\\n\\nCAPTAIN : Yes, sir?\\nQUI-GON : (V.O) Tell them we wish to board at once.\\nCAPTAIN : Yes, sir.\\n\\nThe CAPTAIN looks to her view screen, where NUTE GUNRAY, a Neimoidian trade\\nviceroy, waits for a reply.\\n\\nCAPTAIN : (cont\\'d) With all due respect for the Trade Federation, the\\nAmbassodors for the Supreme Chancellor wish to board immediately.\\nNUTE : Yes, yes, of coarse...ahhh...as you know, our blockade is perfectly\\nlegal, and we\\'d be happy to recieve the Ambassador...Happy to.\\n\\nThe screen goes black. Out the cockpit window, the sinister battleship\\nlooms ever closer.\\n\\nEXT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - DOCKING BAY - SPACE (FX)\\n\\nThe small space cruiser docks in the enormous main bay of the Federation\\nbattleship.\\n\\nINT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - DOCKING BAY - SPACE\\n\\nA PROTOCOL DROID, TC-14, waits at the door to the docking bay. Two WORKER\\nDROIDS, PK-4 and EG-9 watch.\\n\\nPK-4 : They must be important if the Viceroy sent one of those useless\\nprotocol gearheads to greet them.\\n\\nThe door opens, and the Republic cruiser can be seen in the docking bay.\\nTwo darkly robed figures are greeted by TC-14.\\n\\nTC-14 : I\\'m TC-14 at your service. This way, please.\\n\\nThey move off down the hallway.\\n\\nEG-9 : A Republic cruiser! That\\'s trouble...don\\'t you think?\\nPR-4 : I\\'m not made to think.\\n\\nINT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM\\n\\nA door slides open, and the two cloaked shapes are led PAST CAMERA into the\\nformal conference room by TC-14.\\n\\nTC-14 : I hope you honoured sirs with the most comfortable here. My master\\nwill be with you shortly.\\n\\nThe droid bows before OBI-WAN KENOBI and QUI- GON JINN. He backs out the\\ndoor and it closes. The JEDI lower their hoods and look out a large window\\nat the lush green planet of Naboo. QUI-GON sixty years old, has long white\\nhair in a ponytail. He is tall and striking, with blue eyes. OBI-WAN is\\ntwenty five, with very short brown hair, pale skin, and blue eyes. Several\\nexotic, bird-like creatures SING in a cage near the door.\\n\\nOBI-WAN : I have a bad feeling about this.\\nQUI-GON : I don\\'t sense anything.\\nOBI-WAN : It\\'s not about the mission, Master, it\\'s\\nsomethging...elsewhere...elusive.\\nQUI-GON : Don\\'t center on your anxiety, Obi-Wan. Keep your concentration\\nhere and now where it belongs.\\nOBI-WAN : Master Yoda says I should be mindful of the future...\\nQUI-GON : .....but not at the expense of the moment. Be mindful of the\\nliving Force, my young Padawan.\\nOBI-WAN : Yes, Master...how do you think the trade viceroy will deal with\\nthe chancellor\\'s demands?\\nQUI-GON : These Federation types are cowards. The negotiations will be\\nshort.\\n\\nINT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE\\n\\nNUTE GUNRAY and DAULTRAY DOFINE stand, stunned, before TC-14.\\n\\nNUTE : (shaken) What?!? What did you say?\\nTC-14 : The Ambassadors are Jedi Knights, I believe.\\nDOFINE : I knew it! They were sent to force a settlement, eh. Blind me,\\nwe\\'re done for!\\n\\nINT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY\\n\\nA hologram of NUTE , surrounded by BATTLE DROIDS, appears in the conference\\nroom hallway.\\n\\nNUTE : They must be dead by now. Blast, what\\'s left of them.\\n\\nThe hologram fades off, as a BATTLE DROID, OWO-1, cautiously opens the\\ndoor. A deadly green cloud billows from the room. BATTLE DROIDS cock their\\nweapons as a figure stumbles out of the smoke. It is TC-14 , carrying the\\ntray of drinks.\\n\\nTC14 : Oh, excuse me, so sorry.\\n\\nThe PROTOCOL DROID passes the armed camp just as two flashing laser swords\\nfly out of the deadly fog, cutting down several BATTLE DROIDS before they\\ncan fire.\\n\\nINT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE\\n\\nThe bridge is a cocophony of alarms. NUTE and RUNE watch OWO-1 on the\\nviewscreen.\\n\\nOWO-1 : Not sure exactly what...\\n\\nOWO-1 is suddenly cut in half in mid-sentence. RUNE gives NUTE a worried\\nlook.\\n\\nNUTE : What in blazes is going on down there?\\nRUNE : Have you ever encountered a Jedi Knight before, sir?\\nNUTE : Well, not exactly, but I don\\'t...(panicked) Seal off the bridge.\\nRUNE : That won\\'t be enough, sir.\\n\\nThe doors to the bridge SLAM shut.\\n\\nNUTE : I want destroyer droids up here at once!!!\\nRUNE : We will not survive this.\\n\\nINT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY - OUTSIDE BRIDGE\\n\\nQUI-GON cuts several BATTLE DROIDS in half, creating a shower of sparks and\\nmetal parts. OBI-WAN raises his hand, sending several BATTLE DROIDS\\ncrashing into the wall.\\n\\nQUI-GON makes his way to the bridge door and begins to cut through it.\\n\\nINT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE\\n\\nThe CREW is very nervous as sparks start flying around the bridge door.\\nQUI-GON and OBI-WAN are on the view screen.\\n\\nNUTE : Close the blast doors!!!\\n\\nThe huge, very thick blast door slams shut, followed by a second door, then\\na third. There is a hissing sound as the huge doors seal shut. QUI-GON tabs\\nthe door with his sword. The screen goes black as a red spot appears in the\\ncenter of the blast door.\\n\\nRUNE : ...They\\'re still coming through!\\n\\nOn the door, chunks of molten metal begin to drop away.\\n\\nNUTE : Impossible!! This is impossible!!\\nRUNE : Where are those destroyer droids?!\\n\\nINT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY - OUTSIDE BRIDGE\\n\\nTen ugly destroyer WHEEL DROIDS roll down the hallway at full speed. Just\\nbefore they get to the bridge area, they stop and transform into their\\nbattle configuration. QUI-GON can\\'t see them but senses their presence.\\n\\nQUI-GON : Destroyer droids!\\nOBI-WAN : Offhand, I\\'d say this mission is past the negotiaion stage.\\n\\nThe WHEEL DROIDS, led by P-59, rush the entry area from three hallways,\\nblasting away with their laser guns. They stop firing and stand in a\\nsemi-circle as the smoke clears. OBI-WAN and QUI-GON are nowhere to be\\nseen.\\n\\nP-59 : Switch to bio...There they are!\\n\\nThe Jedi materialize at the far end of the hallway and dash through the\\ndoorway that slams shut.

The all look alike, except for\\nthier paint color, and they all seem to be shut down.\\n\\nJAR JAR : Ello, boyos. (no response) Disa wanna longo trip...hey?\\n\\nJAR JAR taps a bright red R-2 UNIT on the head, and its head pops up a bit.\\nHe lets out a gasp as he lifts the head.\\n\\nJAR JAR : (Cont\\'d) Tis opens?...Oooops! Many springs and things come flying\\nout.\\n\\nJAR JAR quickly closes it again, very embarrassed.\\n\\nJAR JAR : (Cont\\'d) Yoi! Just yoken!\\nRIC OLIE : Powers back! That little droid did it. He bypassed the main\\npower drive. Deflector shield up, at maximum.\\n\\nThe lone BLUE DROID finishes his repairs and goes back into the ship. The\\nNaboo spacecraft races away from the Federation battleship.\\n\\nRIC OLIE : There\\'s not enough power to get us to Coruscant...the hyperdrive\\nis leaking.\\nQUI-GON : We\\'ll have to land somewhere to refuel and repair the ship.\\n\\nQUI-GON studies a star chart on a monitor.\\n\\nOBI-WAN : Here, Master.

PANAKA : The Hutts??\\nOBI-WAN : It\\'s risky...but there\\'s no alternative.\\nCAPT. PANAKA : You can\\'t take Her Royal Highness there! The Hutts are\\ngangsters... If they discovered her...\\nQUI-GON : ...It would be no different than if we landed on a system\\ncontrolled by the Federation...except the Hutts aren\\'t looking for her,\\nwhich gives us an advantage.\\n\\nCPATAIN PANAKA takes a deep breath in frustration.\\n\\nEXT.

There we will\\nbe able to make needed repairs, then travel on to Coruscant.\\nCAPTAIN PANAKA : Your Highness, Tatooine is very dangerous. It\\'s controlled\\nby an alliance of gangs called the Hutts. I do not agree with the Jedi on\\nthis.\\nQUI-GON : You must trust my judgement, Your Highness.\\n\\nAMIDALA and PADME exchange looks.

Ni you\\'ll find what you need.\\n\\nARTOO and QUI-GON follow WATTO toward the junk yard, leaving JAR JAR with\\nPADME and the young boy ANAKIN.

PADME is a\\nlittle embarrassed by his stare, but she musters up an amused smile.\\nFinally, he gets the courage to speak.\\n\\nANAKIN : Are you an angel?\\nPADME : What?\\nANAKIN : An angel. I\\'ve heard the deep space pilots talk about them. They\\nlive on the Moons of Iego I thimk. They are the most beautiful creatures in\\nthe universe. They are good and kind, and so pretty they make even the most\\nhardened spice pirate cry.\\n\\nPADME looks at him, not knowing what to say. PADME : I\\'ve never heard of\\nangels.\\n\\nANAKIN : You must be one...maybe you just don\\'t know it.\\nPADME : You\\'re a funny little boy. How do you know so much?\\nANAKIN : Since I was very little, three, I think. My Mom and I were sold to\\nGardulla the Hutt, but she lost us, betting on the Podraces, to Watto,\\nwho\\'s a lot better master than Gardulla, I think.\\nPADME : You\\'re...a slave?\\n\\nANAKIN looks at PADME defiantly.\\n\\nANAKIN : I am a person!

JAR JAR hold on but can\\'t stop it.\\n\\nANAKIN : (Cont\\'d) Hit the nose!\\n\\nJAR JAR hits the nose, and the DROID collapses back into its original\\nstate. ANAKIN and PADME laugh.

He stands before a\\nhyperdrive.\\n\\nWATTO : ...Here it is...a T-14 hyperdrive generator!! Thee in luck, I\\'m the\\nonly one hereabouts who has one...but thee might as well buy a new ship. It\\nwould be cheaper, I think...Sying of which, how\\'s thee going to pay for all\\nthis?\\nQUI-GON : I have 20,000 Republic dataries.\\nWATTO : Republic credits?!? Republic credits are no good out here. I need\\nsomething more real...\\nQUI-GON : I don\\'t have anything else. (raising his hand) But credits will\\ndo fine.\\nWATTO : No they won\\'ta. QUI-GON, using his mind power, waves his hand\\nagain.\\nQUI-GON : Credits will do fine.\\nWATTO : No, they won\\'ta. What you think you\\'re some kinda Jedi, waving your\\nhand around like that? I\\'m a Toydarian. Mind tricks don\\'ta work on me-only\\nmoney. No money, no parts! No deal! And no one else has a T-14 hyperdrive,\\nI promise you that.\\n\\nINT. WATTO\\'S JUNK SHOP - DAY\\n\\nJAR JAR pulls a part out of a stack of parts to inspect it, and they all\\ncome tumblimg down. He struggles to catch them, only to knock more down.\\nANAKIN and PADME are oblivious.\\n\\nANAKIN : ...wouldn\\'t have lasted long if I weren\\'t so good at fixing\\nthings. I\\'m making my own droid...\\n\\nQUI-GON hurries into the shop, followed by ARTOO. QUI-GON : We\\'re leaving.\\nJAR JAR follows QUI-GON.

MOS ESPA - STREET - ALCOVE - DAY\\n\\nQUI-GON, ARTOO, JAR JAR, and PADME have found a quiet spot between two\\nbuildings. The busy street beyond is filled with dangerous looking\\ncreatures. QUI-GON is talking on his com-link, while JAR JAR nervously\\nwatches the street. OBI-WAN is in the main hold of the Naboo craft.\\n\\nQUI-GON : ...Obi-Wan, you\\'re sure there isn\\'t anything of value left on\\nboard?\\nOBI-WAN : (V.O) A few containers of supplies, the Queen\\'s wardrobe, maybe.\\nNot enough for you to barter with. Not in the ammounts you\\'re talking\\nabout.\\nQUI-GON : All right. Another solution will present itself. I\\'ll check back.\\n\\nQUI-GON puts his comlink away and starts out into the main street. JAR JAR\\ngrabs his arm.\\n\\nJAR JAR : Noah gain...da beings hereabouts cawazy. Wesa be robbed un\\ncrunched.\\nQUI-GON : Not likely. We have nothing of value, that\\'s our problem.\\n\\nEXT. MOS ESPA - STREET - MARKET - DAY\\n\\nQUI-GON, PADME, JAR JAR, and ARTOO move out into the street. JAR JAR is\\nwalking behind the others. They walk by an outdoor cafe filled with a rough\\ngang of aliens, one of which is especially ugly, SEBULBA, a spider-like\\ncreature. JAR JAR stops for a moment in front of a stall selling dead frogs\\nhanging on a wire. He looks around to see if anyone is looknig, then sticks\\nout his tongue, and gets hold of one, pulling it into his mouth.\\nUnfortunately, the frog is tied tightly to the wire. The vendor suddenly\\nappears.\\n\\nVENDOR : Hey, that will be seven truguts!!\\n\\nJAR JAR opens his mouth in surprise, and the frog snaps away, ricochets\\naround the market, and lands in Sebulba\\'s soup, splashing him. As JAR JAR\\nmoves away from the VENDOR, SEBULBA jumps up on the table and grabs the\\nhapless Gungan.\\n\\nSEBULBA : (subtitled) Chuba!! (You!!) JAR JAR : Who, mesa?? SEBULBA :\\n(subtitled) Ni chuba na?? (Is this yours??)\\n\\nSEBULBA holds the frog up to the Gungan threateningly. SEVERAL OTHER\\nCREATURES start to gather. SEBULBA shoves JAR JAR to the ground. The Gungan\\ndesperately tries to scramble to safety.\\n\\nJAR JAR : (to himself) Why mesa always da one??\\nANAKIN : (V.O) Because you\\'re afraid.\\n\\nJAR JAR turns to see ANAKNI pushing his way next to him. The boy stands up\\nto SEBULBA in a very self-assured way.\\n\\nANAKIN : (subtitled) Chess ko, Sebulba...Coo wolpa tooney rana. (Careful,\\nSebulba...This one\\'s very connected.)\\n\\nSEBULBA stops his assault on JAR JAR and turns to ANAKIN.\\n\\nSEBULBA : (subtitled) Tooney rana nu pratta dunko, shag. (Connected??

Una noto wo shag, me wompity du\\npom pom. (If you weren\\'t a slave, I\\'d squash you right now.)\\n\\nSEBULBA turns away.\\n\\nANAKIN : (subtitled) Eh, chee bana do mullee ra. (Yeah, it\\'d be a pity if\\nyou had to pay for me.)\\n\\nQUI-GON, PADME and ARTOO arrive.\\n\\nANAKIN : (Cont\\'d) Hi! Your buddy here was about to be turned into orange\\ngoo. He picked a fight with a Dug. An especially dangerous Dug called\\nSebulba.\\nJAR JAR : Nosir, nosir. Mesa hate crunchen. Dat\\'s da last ting mesa wanten.\\nQUI-GON : Nevertheless, the boy is right...you were heading for trouble.\\nThank you, my young friend.\\n\\nPADME looks at ANAKINB and smiles; he smiles back. They start walking down\\nthe crowded street.\\n\\nJAR JAR : Mesa doen nutten!\\nANAKIN : Fear attracts the fearful. He was trying to overcome his fear by\\nsquashing you...be less afraid.\\nPADME : And that works for you.\\nANAKIN : To a point. (he smiles)\\n\\nEXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - SPACESHIP - DAY\\n\\nOBI-WAN stands in front of the Naboo spacecraft as the wind picks up and\\nbegins to whip at his robe. CAPTAIN PANAKA exits the ship and joins him.\\n\\nOBI-WAN : This storm\\'s going to slow them down.\\nCAPT. PANAKA : It looks pretty bad. We\\'d better seal the ship.\\n\\nCAPTAIN PANAKA\\'S comlink sounds off.\\n\\nCAPT. PANAKA : (Cont\\'d) Yes? CAPT. PANAKA : We\\'ll be right there.\\n\\nEXT.

No one can kill a Jedi Knight.\\nQUI-GON : I wish that were so...\\nANAKIN. I had a dream I was a Jedi.

Watto won\\'t let you...\\nANAKIN : Watto doesn\\'t know I\\'ve built it.

She is upset.\\n\\nSHMI : I don\\'t want you to race, Annie...It\\'s awful. I die every time Watto\\nmakes you do it.\\n\\nANAKIN : But Mom, I love it...and they need help...they\\'re in trouble.

He studies it.\\n\\nWATTO : Not bad...not bad...a Nubian.\\nQUI-GON : It\\'s in good order, except for the parts we need.\\nWATTO : ...but what would the boy ride? He smashed up my Pod in the last\\nrace. It will take some time to fix it.\\n\\nANAKIN is embarrassed and steps forward.\\n\\nANAKIN : Ahhhh....it wasn\\'t my fault really...Sebulba flashed me with his\\nvent ports. I actually saved the Pod...mostly.\\nWATTO : (laughing) That you did. The boy is good, no doubts there.\\nQUI-GON : I have...acquired a Pod in a game of chance. \"The fastest ever\\nbuilt.\"\\nWATTO : I hope you didn\\'t kill anyone I know for it. (laughs) So, you\\nsupply the Pod and the entry fee; I supply the boy. We split the winnings\\nfifty-fifty, I think.\\nQUI-GON : Fifty-fifty!?! If it\\'s going to be fifty-fifty, I suggest you\\nfront the cash for the entry. If we win, you keep all the winnings, minus\\nthe cost of the parts I need...If we lose, you keep my ship.\\n\\nWATTO thinks about this. ANAKIN tries not to be nervous.\\n\\nQUI-GON : (Cont\\'d) Either way, you win.\\nWATTO : (subtitled) Deal! Yo bana pee ho-tah, meedee ya. (Your friend is a\\nfollish one, methinks.)\\n\\nEXT.

He gives without any thought of\\nreward.\\nSHMI : He knows nothing of greed. He has...\\nQUI-GON : He has special powers.\\nSHMI : Yes...\\nQUI-GON : He can see things before they happen. That\\'s why he appears to\\nhave such quick reflexes. It is a Jedi trait.\\nSHMI : He deserves better than a slave\\'s life.\\nQUI-GON : The Force is unusally strong with him, that much is clear. Who\\nwas his father?\\nSHMI : There was no father, that I know of...I carried him, I gave him\\nbirth...I can\\'t explain what happened. Can you help him?\\nQUI-GON : I\\'m afraid not.

(Sixth place, not bad.)\\n\\nANAKIN continues to gain on the pack. Tension for SHMI and PADME is\\nunbearable.\\nODY stops in the pits. Droids work on his engines. DUM-4 stands in front of\\nthe engine and is sucked in, causing the engine to die. DUM-4 is spit out\\nthe back of the engine, very bent up. The engine lets out one final wheeze,\\nthen EXPLODES in a puff of smoke.\\n\\nFODE/BEED : - (O.S.)\\nA : Ody Mandrell! Coona wa wunda dunko! (Ody Mandrell into the pits for\\nsome attention.)\\nODY : Droids!\\n\\nTERTER is getting close to SEBULBA, who purposely breaks a small part off\\nhis Pod, sending it into Terter\\'s engine, causing him to veer into ANAKIN,\\nand unhooks one of the main straps on Anakin\\'s engines that links the Pod\\nto his engines.\\nANAKIN struggles to keep control of the little Pod. It whips about wildly.\\nAs the Pod swings near the broken engine strap, ANAKIN grabs for it.\\nFinally, he catches the strap and manages to unhook it to the Pod.\\nSEBULBA cuts the engine of OBITOKI with his side exhaust, and the racer\\ncrashes with a cloud of dust. A THIRD RACER, HABBA, flie into the cloud of\\ndust and crashes into OBITOKI. ANAKIN rounds a corner and heads into the\\ncloud of smoke. He hits a part of one of the engines but regains control.\\n\\nFODE/BEED : - (O.S.)\\nB :At the start of the third and final lap, Sebulba is in the lead, closely\\nfollowed by Skywalker...\\n\\nANAKIN finally catches up with SEBULBA, and runs neck and neck over the\\nrough terrain. JAR JAR, QUI-GON, SHMI, and PADME all SCREAM s ANAKIN comes\\nthrough the arena. The lights in the tower indicate that this is the third\\nand last lap. WATTO begins to worry.\\nSEBULBA uses his side exhaust port to try to cut through Anakin\\'s engines.\\nANAKIN manages to avoid having his engine disabled but is forced off\\ncourse.\\n\\nFODE/BEED : - (O.S.)\\nB : Skywalker is forced onto the service ramp!\\nA : Oh noah!\\n\\nOn a tight corner, ANAKIN dives to the inside and takes the lead.\\n\\nFODE BEED : - (O.S.)\\nB : Amazing... a controlled thrust and he\\'s back on course! What a move!\\n\\nSEBULBA is furious. He stay\\'s right on Anakin\\'s tail, crowding him and\\npushing him through the turns.\\nSEBULBA pushes ANAKIN harder, and the young boy has a difficult time\\nkeeping control. One of the parts on Anakin\\'s engines begins to shake\\nloose. ANAKIN sees it and switches over to an auxiliary system. While he is\\ntrying to accomplish this maneuver, SEBULBA races past him.\\nANAKIN tries to get around SEBULBA, to no avail. Every move ANAKIN makes,\\nSEBULBA is able to block.\\nFinally, ANAKIN fakes a move into the inside as he usually does, then tries\\nto go around SEBULBA on the outside. They race sid by side down the final\\nstretch of the track.\\n\\nFODE/BEED : - (O.S.)\\nB : He\\'s catching Sebulba.\\nA : Inkabunga. (Incredible!)\\n\\nSEBULBA veers toward ANAKIN and bangs into his Pod. He crashes into ANAKIN\\nover and over. The young boy struggles to maintain control as the steering\\nrods on the two Pods become hooked together. SEBULBA laughs at ANAKIN.\\n\\nFODE/BEED : - (O.S.)\\nB : That little human being is out of his mind.\\nA : Punda tah punda! (They\\'re neck and neck!)\\nB : They\\'re side by side!\\nA : Bongo du bongu! (Shoulder to shoulder!)\\n\\nAs they head for the final stretch, ANAKIN fights to unlock the steering\\nrods by trying to pull away from SEBULBA. The strain on the steering rod is\\ntremendous. Suddenly, ANAKIN\\'s steering arm breaks, and his Pos starts\\nspinning.\\nThe release of tension sends SEBULBA into an ancient statue. One engine\\nEXPLODES, then the other. SEBULBA skids through the fire-balls, blackened,\\nbut unhurt. He slides to a smoking stop, gets out of his racer, and throws\\nwhat\\'s left of a shifter arm on the ground. Suddenly he realizes his pants\\nare on fire, and he struggles to put them out. ANAKIN flies through the\\nEXPLOSION as the crowd stands, CHERRING. PADME and JAR JAR jump up and down\\nwith excitment, PADME screaming for joy. ARTOO and KITSTER whistle\\nhysterically. QUI-GON and SHMI smile.

CHANCELLOR VALORUM sits in an elevated area in\\nthe center. Hindreds of AIDES and DROIDS hurry about. SENATOR PALPATINE,\\nQUEEN AMIDALA, EIRTA, RABE, and CAPTAIN PANAKA sit in the Naboo\\ncongressional box, which is actually a floating platform. PALPATINE leans\\nover to the QUEEN.\\n\\nPALPATINE : If the Federation moves to defer the motion...Your Majesty,\\nIbeg of you to ask for a resolution to end this congressional session.\\nAMIDALA : I wish I had your confidence in this, Senator.\\nPALPATINE : You must force a new election for Supreme Chancellor...I\\npromise you there are many who will support us...it is our best chance...\\nYour Majesty, our only, chance.\\nAMIDALA : You truely believe Chancellor Valorum will not bring our motion\\nto a vote?\\nPALAPATINE : He is distracted...he is afraid.

It\\'s against all the rules of procedure.\\n\\nA third box representing Malastare moves into the center of the room. AKS\\nMOE, the Ambassador, addresses the convention.\\n\\nAKS MOE : The Congress of Malastare concurs with the honorable delegate\\nfrom the Trade Federation. A commision must be appointed...that is the law.\\nVALORUM : The point...\\n\\nVALORUM confers with several of his AIDES and VICE CHAIRMAN MAS AMEDDA.\\nPALPATINE whispers something to the QUEEN.\\n\\nPALPATINE : Enter the bureaucrats, the true rulers of the Republic, and on\\nthe payroll of the Trade Federation, I might add. This is where Chancellor\\nValorum\\'s strength will dissapear.\\nVALORUM : The point is conceded...Section 523A take precedence here. Queen\\nAmidala of the Naboo, will you defer your motion to allow a commission to\\nexplore the validity of your accusations?\\n\\nQUEEN AMIDALA is angry but remains composed.\\n\\nAMIDALA : (angrily) I will not defer...I have come before you to resolve\\nthis attack on our sovereignty now. I was not elected to watch my people\\nsuffer and die while you discuss this invasion in a committee. If this body\\nis not capable of action, I suggest new leadership is needed. I move for a\\n\"vote of no confidence\"...in Chancellor Valorum\\'s leadership.\\nVALORUM : What?...No!\\n\\nThis causes a great stir in the assembly. A loud mumur cresendos into a\\nroar of approval and jeers. CHANCELLOR VALORUM is stunned and stands\\nspeechless. His Vice Chair, MAS AMEDDA, takes over.\\n\\nMAS AMEDDA : Order!

VALORUM talks to MAS AMEDDA.\\n\\nASSEMBLY : Vote now! Vote now! Vote now!\\n\\nPALPATINE stands next to AMIDALA.\\n\\nPALPATINE : You see, Your Majaesty, the tide is with us...Valorum will be\\nvoted out, I assure you, and they will elect in a new Chancellor, a strong\\nChancellor, one who will not let our tragedy continue...\\nMAS AMEDDA : Thew Supreme Chancellor requests a recess.

Fear is the path to the dark side... fear leads to\\nanger... anger leads to hate.. hate leads to suffering.\\nANAKIN : (angrily) I am not afraid!\\nYODA : A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind.

We are symbionts with the midi-chlorians.\\nANAKIN : Symbionts?\\nQUI-GON : Life forms living together for mutual advantage.

Your Highness, this is a battle I do not think we can win.\\nPADME : The battle is a diversion. The Gungans must draw theDroid Army away\\nfrom the cities. We can enter the city using the secret passages on the\\nwaterfall side. Once we get to the main entrance, Captain Pnaka will create\\na diversion, so that we can enter the palace and capture the Viceroy.\\nWithout the Viceroy, they will be lost and confused.\\n\\nQUI-GON and OBI-WAN look on with interest.\\n\\nPADME : (Cont\\'d) What do you think, Master Jedi?\\nQUI-GON : The Viceroy will be well guarded.\\nCAPT. PANAKA : The difficulty\\'s getting into the throne room. Once we\\'re\\ninside, we shouldn\\'t have a problem.\\nQUI-GON : There is a possibility with this diversion many Gungans will be\\nkilled.\\nBOSS NASS : Wesa ready to do are-sa part.\\n\\nJAR JAR smiles a very worried and sheepish grin. ANAKIN watches with\\ninterest, as does ARTOO.\\n\\nPADME : We have a plan which should immobilize the Droid Army. We will send\\nwhat pilots we have to knock out the Droid control ship which is orbiting\\nthe planet. If we can get past their rayshields, we can sever communication\\nand their droids will be helpless.\\nQUI-GON : A well-conceived plan. However, there\\'s great risk. The weapons\\non your fighters may not penetrate the shields on the control ship.\\nOBI-WAN : And there\\'s an even bigger danger. If the Vicroy escapes, Your\\nHighness, he will return with another droid army.\\nPADME : That is why we must not fail to get to the Viceroy. Everything\\ndepends on it.\\n\\nINT.

It appears to be made up of primitives. We do\\nnot expect much resistance.\\nOOM-9 : I am increasing security at all Naboo detention camps.\\nDARTH MAUL : I feel there is more to this, My Master. The two Jedi may be\\nusing the Queen for their own purposes.\\nDARTH SIDIOUS : The Jedi cannot become involved. They can only protect the\\nQueen. Even Qui-Gon Jinn will not break that conenant.... This will work to\\nour advantage...\\nNUTE : I have your approval to proceed then, My Lord.\\nDARTH SIDIOUS : Proceed. Wipe them put...all of them. INT.

TURRET ROOM - NABOO PALACE - LATE DAY\\n\\nThe sun streams into the multi-windowed room at a low angle. It is not\\nquite sunset. YODA paces before OBI-WAN, who is kneeling in the center of\\nthe room.\\n\\nYODA : Confer on you, the level of Jedi Knight the Coucil does. But agree\\non you taking this boy as your Padawan learner, I do not.\\nOBI-WAN : Qui-Gon believed in him. I believe in Qui-Gon.\\nYODA : The Chosen One the boy may be; nevertheless, grave danger I fear in\\nhis training.\\nOBI-WAN : Master Yoda, Igave Qui-Gon my word. I will train Anakin. Without\\nthe approval of the Council if I must.\\nYODA : Qui-Gon\\'s defiance I sense in you. Need that, you do not. Agree, the\\ncouncil does. Your apprentice, young Skywalker will be.\\n\\nEXT.

ANAKIN looks to\\nOBI-WAN.\\n\\nOBI-WAN : He is one with the Force, Anakin...You must let go.\\nANAKIN : What will happen to me now?\\nOBI-WAN : I am your Master now. You will become a Jedi, I promise.\\n\\nTo one side, MACE WINDU turns to YODA.\\n\\nMACE WINDU : There is no doubt.

NABOO CRUISER -- DAWN\\n\\nA LIEUTENANT and TWO SECURITY OFFICERS address SENATOR AMIDALA as the Cruiser nears the planet. \\n\\nLIEUTENANT: Senator, weÕre making our final approach in to Coruscant. \\nSENATOR AMIDALA: Very good, Lieutenant. \\n\\nEXT. CITYSCAPE (CORUSCANT) Ð DAWN\\n\\nThe ships skim across the surface of the city landscape. The sun glints off the chrome hulls of the sleek Naboo spacecraft as they navigate between the buildings of the capital planet. The ships fly into a thick bank of smog that covers the skyline.  \\n\\nEXT. LANDING PLATFORM (CORUSCANT) Ð DAWN\\n\\nTwo Naboo fighters land on one leaf of a three-leaf-clover landing platform. The Naboo Cruiser lands on the central leaf, and the third fighter lands on the remaining platform. \\n\\nA small GROUP OF DIGNITARIES waits to welcome the Senator. A FEMALE PILOT steps out of her N-1 and walks toward the group. Behind her, ARTOO-DETOO drops down from the Naboo fighter. The other FIGHTER PILOT jumps from the wing of his ship and removes his helmet, revealing himself as a black man with an eyepatch over one eye. He is CAPTAIN TYPHO, Senator AmidalaÕs Security Officer. He moves over to the FEMALE PILOT. \\n\\nTYPHO: We made it. \\n\\nThe ramp lowers. TWO NABOO GUARDS appear first. Then Senator Amidala, her handmaiden VERSE and FOUR TROOPERS descend the ramp. Amidala is more beautiful now than she was ten years earlier when, as Queen, she was freeing her people from the yoke of the Trade Federation. The dignitaries start to move forward. \\n\\nTYPHO: I guess I was wrong, there was no danger at allÉ\\nFEMALE PILOT: ThereÕs always danger, Captain. Sometimes weÕre just lucky enough to avoid it.\\n\\nSenator Amidala reaches the foot of the ramp --  \\n\\n-- when suddenly there is a blinding FLASH and a HUGE EXPLOSION!!! The dignitaries and pilots are hurled to the ground as the gleaming starship is instantly destroyed. \\n\\nKlaxons blare, alarms sound! In what seems like an instant, many dead and wounded victims lay scattered about the platform. Captain Typho and the escort pilot gets up and run to where Senator Amidala lies dying. The female pilot pulls off her helmet, revealing herself as the real PADME NABERRIE AMIDALA, Senator of Naboo.\\n\\nPADME: CordeÉ\\n\\nPadme kneels down and gathers her decoy double in her arms. The woman is horribly injured Ð itÕs clear nothing can save her. CordeÕs eyes open. She looks up at herÉ\\n\\nCORDE: IÕm so sorry, mÕladyÉ iÕve failed you, senatorÉ.\\nPADME: NoÉ.\\n\\nCorde dies in PadmeÕs arms without hearing her denial. She hugs her late decoy, sobbing uncontrollably.\\n\\nTYPHO: MÕLady, you are still in danger here.\\n\\nPadme lowers CordeÕs lifeless body to the ground, slowly gets up, and looks with tear-streaked eyes at the devastation around her. Artoo Detoo rolls up alongside them -- TyphoÕs Artoo unit lies destroyed in the distance. Typho looks around nervously.\\n\\nPADME: I shouldnÕt have come back.\\nTYPHO: This vote is very important. You did your duty -- Corde did hers. Now come.\\n\\nPadme doesnÕt move. She continues to stare glassy-eyed at the carnage around her. \\n\\nTYPHO: Senator Amidala, please!\\n\\nShe slowly turns, and they walk away. Artoo lets out a small whimper and rolls after them.\\n\\nEXT. SENATE BUILDING Ð DAY\\n\\nThe massive Senate Building glistens in the afternoon sun. Small patches of fog have still to burn off. \\n\\nINT. SENATE CHAMBER Ð DAY\\n \\nThe vast rotunda is buzzing with chatter. MAS AMEDDA, the Supreme ChancellorÕs majordomo, tries to quiet things down as SUPREME CHANCELLOR PALPATINE confers with an aide, UV GIZEN, who rides on a small one-man floating scooter. \\n\\nUV GIZEN: They are afraid, Supreme Chancellor. Many have heard reports of demonstrations, even violent activity near this very building. The separatists Ð\\nPALPATINE: They are a troublesome group. It would seem that Count Dooku has whipped them into murderous frenzy. Or perhaps their frustrations are mounting despite the effort of that estimable former Jedi to calm them. Either way, the separatists must be taken seriously. \\n\\nMas Amedda pounds the podium for silence. \\n\\nMAS AMEDDA: Order! We shall have order! The motion for the Republic to commission an army takes precedence, and that is what we will vote on at this time.\\n\\nEverything quiets down. The aide disperses, and with a grim look on his face, Palpatine then steps to the podium.\\n\\nPALPATINE: My esteemed colleagues, excuse meÉI have just received some tragic and disturbing news. Senator Amidala of the Naboo systemÉhas been assassinated. \\n\\nThere is a shocked silence in the vast arena. \\n\\nPALPATINE: ThisÉ grievous blowÉis especially personal to me. Before I became Chancellor, I served Amidala when she was Queen. She was a great leader who fought for justice Ð not only here in this honorable assembly, but also on her home planet. (sad beat, then continues) She was so loved, the people would have gladly elected her Queen for life. She believed in public service, and she fervently believed in democracy. Her death is a great loss to us all. We will all mourn her as a relentless champion of freedomÉ and as a dear friend. \\n\\nA moment of silence. Then three-eyed Senator ASK AAK of the Congress of Malastare raises his floating podium into view before Chancellor PalpatineÕs podium. \\n\\nASK AAK: How many more senators will die before this civil strife ends?!? We must confront these rebels now, and we need an army to do it!!\\n\\nA second pod comes into view. Inside it is DARSANA, Ambassador of Glee Anselm. \\n\\nDARSANA: Why werenÕt the Jedi able to stop this assassination?? We are no longer safe under their protection!!\\n\\nSenator ORN FREE TAA floats into view next. \\n\\nORN FREE TAA: The Republic needs more security NOW Ð before it comes to war!! \\nPALPATINE: Must I remind the Senator from Malastare that negotiations are continuing with the separatists? Peace is our objective here, not war -- \\nORN FREE TAA: (incredulous) You say this while your friend lies dead, assassinated by those same people with whom you wish to negotiate?!? \\n\\nThe crowd erupts in a fury. Dissenting opinions fill the air, and Mas Amedda tries to calm things down. Suddenly, to PalpatineÕs and the SenateÕs surprise, Senator Amidala (with Captain Typho, a well-dressed JAR JAR BINKS and the handmaiden DORME in tow) comes forward in her pod!! \\n\\nPADME: My noble colleagues, I concur with the Supreme Chancellor. At all costs, we do not want war!! \\n\\nA shocked beat of silence. Then the Senate fills with wild cheering and applause. Palpatine is stunned, but quickly recovers. \\n\\nPALPATINE: I-it is with great surprise and joy the chair recognizes the Senator from Naboo, Padme Amidala. \\nPADME: Less than an hour ago, an assassination attempt was made against my life. One of my bodyguards and six others were ruthlessly and senselessly murdered. (lets that sink in) I was the target. But more importantly, I believe this security measure before you was the target. I have led the opposition to build an armyÉbut there is somebody in this body who will stop at nothing to assure itsÕ passageÉ\\n\\nSeveral Senators leap out of their seats, booing Padme loudly. Others shake their heads in confusion Ð is Padme accusing one of them of attempted murder?!?\\n\\nPADME: I warn you. If you vote to create this army, war will follow. I have experienced the misery of war firsthand Ð I do not wish to do so again. \\n\\nThe Senate is filled with jeers and boos. \\n\\nORN FREE TAA: This is insanity, I say! I move that we defer this vote immediately! \\n\\nThe Senators are now arguing and yelling at each other, both for and against her statements. PadmeÕs iron temper slips. \\n\\nPADME: WAKE UP, SENATORS!!!\\n\\nThe Senate is stunned into silence. \\n\\nPADME: You must wake up!! If we offer the separatists violence, they can only show us violence in return! Many will lose their lives, ALL will lose their freedom! This decision could well destroy the very foundation of our great Republic! I pray you do not let fear push you into a disastrous decision. VOTE DOWN this security measure, which is nothing less than a declaration of war! Does anyone here WANT that?? I cannot believe they doÉ\\n\\nThere is an undercurrent of boos and groans from the Senators. Orn Free Taa moves his pod next to PadmeÕs. \\n\\nORN FREE TAA: My motion to defer the vote must be dealt with first. That is the rule of law. \\n\\nPadme stares daggers at the obese TwiÕlek senator. Palpatine looks at her with a mixture of pity and weariness. \\n\\nPALPATINE: In view of the lateness of the hour and the seriousness of this motion, we will take up these matters tomorrow. Until then, the Senate stands adjourned. \\n\\nOn PadmeÕs pod, a small viewscreen comes up, saying that the Chancellor wants to meet with her in private. \\n\\nWIPE TO:\\n\\nEXT. EXECUTIVE QUARTERS BUILDING - DAY \\n\\nThe giant towers of the Republic Executive Building seem to reach the heavens. Traffic clogs the smoggy sky.\\n\\nINT. CHANCELLORÕS OFFICE Ð DAY\\n\\nA weary Chancellor Palpatine sits behind his desk with his female aide SLY MOORE alongside him. Two RED-CLAD ROYAL GUARDS stand on either side of the door at the other end of the room. YODA, PLO KOON, KI-ADI MUNDI and MACE WINDU sit across from him. Behind them stand the Jedi LUMINARA UNDULI and her Padawan, BARRISS OFFEE.\\n\\nPALPATINE: I don\\'t know how much longer I can hold off the vote, my friends. And I fear that further delay on this definitive issue might well erode the Republic through attrition. More and more star systems are joining the separatists.\\nMACE WINDU: When the vote is done, if they do break away - \\nPALPATINE: No! I will not let this Republic that has stood for a thousand years be split in two! My negotiations will not fail. \\nMACE WINDU: If they do, you must realize there aren\\'t enough Jedi to protect the Republic. We are keepers of the peace, not soldiers.\\nPALPATINE: Master Yoda, do you think it will really come to war?\\n\\nThe little green Jedi Master closes his eyes and concentrates.\\n \\nYODA: Worse than war, I fearÉmuch worse. \\nPALPATINE: What?\\nMACE WINDU: What do you sense, Master?\\nYODA: HmmÉThe Dark Side clouds everything. Impossible to see, the future is. But this I am sure ofÉ(opens his eyes) Do their duty, the Jedi will. \\n\\nA muted buzzer sounds. A hologram of a Rodian aide, DAR WAC, appears on the ChancellorÕs desk. \\n\\nDAR WAC: (in Huttese) The Loyalist Committee has arrived, Your Honor. \\nPALPATINE: Good. Send them in. We will discuss this matter later.\\n\\nMace rubs his chin, his thoughts troubled. The others all stand as Senator Amidala, Captain Typho, Mas Amedda, Dorme, and Senators (BAIL ORGANA, Jar Jar Binks, and HOROX RYYDER) and their ATTENDANTS enter the office. As Yoda moves to greet the Senator, he taps Amidala with his cane. \\n\\nYODA: Padme, your tragedy on the landing platformÉterrible. With you the Force is strong, young Senator. Seeing you alive brings warm feelings to my heart. \\nPADME: Thank you, Master Yoda. Do you have any idea who was behind this attack? \\nMACE WINDU: (gets up and joins them) Our intelligence points to disgruntled spice miners on the moon of Naboo. \\n\\nPadme frowns, shaking her head. \\n\\nPADME: I donÕt wish to disagreeÉbut I think that Count Dooku was behind it. \\n\\nThe assembled group looks at each other in surprise. Mace Windu is most disturbed of all. \\n\\nKI-ADI MUNDI: He is a political idealist. Not a murderer.\\nMACE WINDU: You know, my Lady, Count Dooku was once a Jedi. (smiles) He couldnÕt assassinate anyone. ItÕs not in his character. \\nPALPATINE: Count Dooku has always avoided any kind of conflict. It appears he has no desire to start a war. Why would he kill you? To what end?\\nPADME: I donÕt know. But everything in my being tells me he was behind it. \\nYODA: Hmm. In dark times, nothing is what it appears to be. But the fact remains for certain, SenatorÉin grave danger you are. \\n\\nPalpatine walks to the window and looks out at the vast city, his back to the others. He thinks for a moment, then turns around. \\n\\nPALPATINE: (to Mace) Master Jedi, may I suggest the Senator be placed under the protection of your graces. \\nBAIL ORGANA: Do you really think that is a wise decision under these stressful times? Thousands of systems have gone over to the separatists, and many more may soon join them. The Jedi are our -- \\nPADME: Chancellor, if I may comment, I do not believe the Ð\\nPALPATINE: (finishes her sentence) -- situation is that serious, no. But I do, Senator. \\nPADME: Chancellor, please! I donÕt want any more guards! \\n\\nPalpatine considers this. Unnoticed, Yoda narrows his eyes and scowls at him. \\n\\nPALPATINE: I realize all too well that additional security might be disruptive for you. But perhaps someone you are familiar with, an old friend, likeÉMaster Kenobi?\\n\\nHe looks at Mace as he suggests this. Mace nods. \\n\\nMACE WINDU: ThatÕs possible. HeÕs just returned from a border dispute on Ansion. \\nPALPATINE: You must remember him, MÕLady Ð he watched over you during the blockade conflict. \\nPADME: This is not necessary, Chancellor. \\nPALPATINE: I insist Ð do it for me, MÕLady, please. I will rest easier. We had a big scare today. The thought of losing youÉ is unbearable. \\n\\nPadme lets out a reluctant sigh. \\n\\nMACE WINDU: I will have Obi-Wan report to you immediately, MÕLady. \\nPADME: (resigned) Thank you, Master Jedi. \\n\\nMace bows before Padme and leaves. Yoda hobbles to her side next and leans into her ear. \\n\\nYODA: Too little about yourself you worry Senator, and too much about politics. Be mindful of your danger, Padme. Accept our help.  \\n\\nThe Jedi leave the office.\\n\\nEXT. APARTMENT BUILDING Ð LATE DAY\\n\\nA graceful skyscraper shines in the sunset light of Coruscant.\\n\\nINT. APARTMENT BUILDING ELEVATOR Ð LATE DAY\\n\\nIn a moving windowed elevator attached to the outside of the Senate Building, two Jedi wait. They are OBI-WAN KENOBI and ANAKIN SKYWALKER. Obi-Wan is now thirty-five, with long hair and a graying beard. He strongly resembles the late Qui-Gon Jinn now, in more ways than one. Anakin, meanwhile, is virtually unrecognizable. The nineteen-year-old towers over Obi-Wan, and is lanky and handsome. While he wears his hair in the manner of a Padawan Learner (short and spiky with a long braid), his uniform is darker and more stylish than the usual apprentice. Obi-Wan waits patiently as the elevator climbs; Anakin squirms and nervously rearranges his robes. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: You seem a little on edge. \\nANAKIN: Not at all. \\nOBI-WAN: I havenÕt felt you this tense sinceÉsince we fell into that nest of gundarks. \\nANAKIN: You fell into that nightmare, Master, and I rescued you. Remember? \\nOBI-WAN: (beat) Oh...yes. \\n\\nObi-Wan laughs quietly. Anakin grins, but remains on edge. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: YouÕre sweating. Relax. Take a deep breath. \\nANAKIN: I havenÕt seen her in ten years, MasterÉ\\nOBI-WAN: SheÕs not the Queen anymore. \\nANAKIN: (under his breath) ThatÕs not why IÕm nervous. \\n\\nINT. APARTMENT BUILDING Ð APARTMENT CORRIDOR Ð TWILIGHT\\n\\nThe door to the apartment slides open. Jar Jar walks into the corridor, and spots Obi-Wan and Anakin exiting the elevator. He recognizes Obi-Wan and becomes extremely excited, jumping around in glee, shaking his hand. \\n\\nJAR JAR: Obi? OBI!! Mesa sooooo smilinÕ to see yousa!! WAHOOO!!! \\nOBI-WAN: (grins) ItÕs good to see you too, Jar Jar. \\n\\nJar Jar calms down and looks over at Anakin.\\n \\nJAR JAR: And dis, mesa guessinÕ, issen yousa apprenÉticeÉ (like Andy KaufmanÕs Latka) Nooooooo!!! ANI?!?\\n\\nAnakin nods and smiles. \\n\\nJAR JAR: Nooooooo!! Little bitty Ani?!?\\n\\nAnakin nods again, grinning. \\n\\nJAR JAR: NOOOOOOO!! Yousa so biggen!!  Yiyiyiyiyi!! Ani!! \\nANAKIN: Hi, Jar Jar. \\n\\nJar Jar grabs hold of Anakin and envelops him in a huge hug. \\n\\nJAR JAR: Shesa expecting yousa. AniÉMesa no believen!\\n\\nINT. APARTMENT BUILDING, AMIDALAÕS APARTMENT -- TWILIGHT\\n\\nPadme is in a conference with Captain Typho and Dorme at the open balcony of her apartment. Jar Jar enters the room, followed by the two Jedi.\\n\\nJAR JAR: Senator Padme! Mesa palos here. Lookee lookee, Senator. Desa Jedi arriven!\\n\\nPadme, Dorme and Typho leave the balcony and walk into the apartment as Obi-Wan and Anakin stop before the Senator. Obi-Wan steps forward and bows before Padme. Anakin stares at Padme; she glances at him.  \\n\\nOBI-WAN: ItÕs a great pleasure to see you again, MÕLady.\\n\\nPadme walks over to Obi-Wan and takes his hand in hers. \\n\\nPADME: ItÕs been far too long, Master Kenobi. IÕm so glad our paths have crossed againÉbut I must warn you that I think your presence here is totally unnecessary. \\nOBI-WAN: Well, IÕm sure the Jedi Council has their reasons. \\n\\nPadmeÕs eyes go wide as she noticesÉ\\n\\nPADME: ANI?!?\\n\\nShe doesnÕt seem to recognize the now fully-grown Anakin. The apprentice steps forward before her.\\n\\nPADME: My goodness, youÕve grown. \\n\\nThey stare at each other for a long moment. \\n\\nANAKIN: So have youÉgrown more beautiful, I mean.\\t\\n\\nObi-Wan glares at AnakinÕs attempt to be smooth. Anakin notices and gets nervous. \\n\\nANAKIN: Well, for a Senator, I meanÉ\\n\\nPadme laughs and shakes her head. \\n\\nPADME: Ani, youÕll always be that little boy I knew on Tatooine. \\n\\nAnakin blushes and looks down as Obi-Wan and Typho smile. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: Our presence here will be invisible, MÕLady, I can assure you.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\nThe group sits down to discuss the security arrangements. \\n\\nTYPHO: IÕm Captain Typho, head of Her MajestyÕs security service. Queen Jamillia has been informed of your assignment. IÕm very grateful youÕre here, Master Kenobi. The situation is more dangerous than the Senator will admit.\\nPADME: I don\\'t need more security, I need answers. I want to know whoÕs trying to kill me!\\nOBI-WAN: (frowning) We\\'re here to protect you Senator, not to start an investigation.\\nANAKIN: We will find out whoÕs trying to kill you, Padme. I promise you. \\n\\nObi-Wan looks askance at Anakin as he boldly declares this. HeÕs done it again. Anakin bites his lip, in frustration and shame. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: We will not exceed our mandate, my young Padawan learner.\\nANAKIN: I meant in the interest of protecting her, Master, of courseÉ\\nOBI-WAN: We will not go through this exercise again, Anakin. And you will pay attention to my lead.\\nANAKIN: Why?\\nOBI-WAN: (sharply) What??!!\\n\\nJar Jar gulps.\\n\\nANAKIN: Why else do you think we were assigned to protect her, if not to find the killer? Protection is a job for local security, not Jedi. It\\'s overkill, Master. Investigation is implied in our mandate.\\nOBI-WAN: We will do exactly as the Council has instructed. (beat) And you will learn your place, young one.\\n\\nAnakin lowers his head. Padme and Typho have been watching this scene sympathetically. Now Padme gets up. \\n\\nPADME: Perhaps with merely your presence, the mysteries surrounding this threat will be revealed.  Now, if you will excuse me, I will retire.\\n\\nEveryone else gets up. Obi-Wan gives Amidala a slight bow as she and Dorme leave the room.\\n\\nTYPHO: Well, I know I feel a lot better having you here. \\nANAKIN: What have you learned? \\n\\nObi-Wan throws Anakin a warning look. \\n\\nTYPHO: Not much. SheÕs very determined to deal with the separatists through negotiation and not force. But the attempts on her life, even though theyÕve failed, have only strengthened the opposition to her viewpoint in the Senate. \\nOBI-WAN: And since the separatists would not logically wish to see a Republic army formedÉ\\nTYPHO: WeÕre left without a clue. In any such incident, the first questioning eyes turn towards Count Dooku and the separatistsÉ(quickly, on Obi-WanÕs sour look) or to some of those loyal to his movement at least. But why theyÕd go after Senator Amidala is anyoneÕs guess. \\nOBI-WAN: (Òend of discussionÓ) And we are not here to guess, but merely to protect. \\nTYPHO: (bows) IÕll have an officer situated on every floor, and IÕll be at the control center downstairs. \\n\\nTypho leaves, and Obi-Wan starts to look around the apartment. \\n\\nJAR JAR: Mesa busten wit happiness seein yousa again, Ani. Desa bad times, bombad times.\\nANAKIN: (despondent) She hardly even recognized me, Jar Jar. IÕve thought about her every day since we parted, andÉ she\\'s forgotten me completely. \\nJAR JAR: Shesa happy. Happier den mesa seein her in a longo time. \\nOBI-WAN: YouÕre focusing on the negative, Anakin. Be mindful of your thoughts. (kind smile) She was pleased to see us. Now lets check the security. \\nANAKIN: Yes, my master.\\n\\nEXT. SKYSCRAPER LEDGE Ð NIGHT\\n\\nAn armor-clad bounty hunter, JANGO FETT, waits on the ledge of a skyscraper as another bounty hunter, ZAM WESELL, a woman with a veiled face, steps from her hovering green speeder and approaches Fett. \\n\\nJANGO FETT: You know that we failed? \\nZAM WESELL: You told me to kill those in the Naboo starship. I hit the ship, but they used a decoy. Those who were aboard are all dead. \\nJANGO FETT: We\\'ll have to try something more subtle this time, Zam. ÊMy client is getting impatient. Ê\\n\\nFett hands Zam a transparent tube about a foot long, containing centipede-like KOUHUNS.\\n\\nJANGO FETT: Take these. ÊBe careful. ÊThey\\'re very poisonous.\\n\\nShe turns to leave, but Fett calls her back. \\n\\nJANGO FETT: ZamÉ there can be no mistakes this time. She had better not escape you. \\nZAM WESELL: She wonÕt.\\n\\nZam attaches her veil across the bottom of her face. She turns again and walks toward her speeder.\\n\\nWIPE TO: \\n\\nEXT. JEDI TEMPLE (CORUSCANT) Ð NIGHT\\n\\nThe vast Jedi Temple sits on an endless flat plain, silhouetted against the traffic-filled sky.\\n\\nINT. JEDI TEMPLE, CORRIDOR -- NIGHT \\n\\nMace Windu and Yoda walk down a long hallway, silhouetted by a lit room at the end.\\n\\nMACE WINDU: Why couldnÕt we foresee this attack on the Senator? This should have been no surprise. \\nYODA: Masking the future is this disturbance in the Force. \\nMACE WINDU: (sighs) The prophecy is coming true Ð the Dark Side is growing. \\nYODA: And only those who have turned to the Dark Side can sense the possibilities of the future.\\nMACE WINDU: ItÕs been ten years, and the Sith still have yet to show themselves. Do you think they are behind thisÉdisturbance?\\nYODA: (long beat) Out there, they are. A certainty that is.\\nMACE WINDU: Do you think Obi-WanÕs apprentice will be able to bring balance to the Force?\\nYODA: Only if he chooses to follow his destiny.\\n\\nThere is a long silence as they walk away. Only footsteps are heard.\\n\\nINT. APARTMENT BUILDING, AMIDALAÕS APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM Ð NIGHT\\n\\nAnakin is standing in the living room. He is in a meditative state. It is quiet. We hear distant footsteps in the corridor outside the apartment. Suddenly AnakinÕs eyes pop open. His eyes dart around the room. He reaches for his lightsaber, then smiles and puts it back on his belt.\\n\\nThe door to the apartment slides open, and Obi-Wan enters.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Captain Typho has more than enough men downstairs. No assassin will try that way. Any activity up here? \\nANAKIN: Quiet as a tomb. I donÕt like just waiting here for something to happen to her.\\n\\nObi-Wan checks a palm-sized view scanner he has pulled out of his utility belt. It shows a shot of Artoo by the door, but no sign of Padme on the bed.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: What\\'s going on?\\n\\nAnakin shrugs.\\n\\nANAKIN: Aw, she covered the cameras. (sigh) I don\\'t think she liked me watching her.\\nOBI-WAN: What is she thinking?\\nANAKIN: She programmed Artoo to warn us if there is an intruder.\\n\\nINT. APARTMENT BUILDING, AMIDALAÕS APARTMENT, BEDROOM Ð NIGHT\\n\\nPadme is asleep in her bed, lit only by the light of the city outside her window coming through the blinds. Artoo stands in the corner of the bedroom. His power is off. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: (V.O.) It\\'s not an intruder I\\'m worried about. There are many other ways to kill a Senator.\\nANAKIN: (V.O) I know, but we also want to catch this assassin. DonÕt we, Master?  \\n\\nINT. APARTMENT BUILDING, AMIDALAÕS APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM -- NIGHT\\n\\nAnakin and Obi-Wan continue their conversation. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: (sour) YouÕre using her as bait.\\nANAKIN: It was her idea. DonÕt worry, no harm will come to her Ð I can sense everything going on in that room. Trust me. \\nOBI-WAN: ItÕs too risky. Besides, your senses arenÕt that attuned, my young apprentice. \\nANAKIN: And yours are? \\n\\nObi-Wan glowers at the implied challenge. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: Possibly. \\nANAKIN: Time will tell then, whoÕs more in touch with the Force. \\n\\nEXT.

I haven\\'t seen her since I was littleÉ \\nOBI-WAN: Your love for her was, and remains, deep. ThatÕs hardly reason for despair. \\nANAKIN: But these are more than Ð (shakes his head) Are they dreams, or visions? Of something that is yet to be? \\nOBI-WAN: I\\'m not sure what it means... but dreams pass in time. \\n\\nThe two walk back into the apartment. \\n\\nANAKIN: IÕd much rather dream of PadmŽ. Just being around her again isÉ intoxicating. \\nOBI-WAN: Be mindful of your thoughts, Anakin, they betray you. YouÕve made a commitment to the Jedi Order, a commitment not easily broken. And the JediÕs stand on such relationships is uncompromising. Attachment is forbidden. (snorts) And donÕt forget sheÕs a politician, and theyÕre not to be trusted. \\n\\nINT. APARTMENT BUILDING, AMIDALAÕS APARTMENT, BEDROOM Ð NIGHT\\n\\nANAKIN: (V.O.) SheÕs not like the others in the Senate, Master.\\n\\nAs Padme sleeps, the probe droid approaches outside her window. It sends out several small arms that attach to the window, creating sparks that shut down the security system. Then a large arm cuts a small hole in the glass. A faint sound is heard as the small section of glass is removed from the window. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: (V.O.) It\\'s my experience that Senators focus only on pleasing those who fund their campaigns... and theyÕre by no means scared of forgetting the niceties of a democracy to get those funds.\\nANAKIN: (V.O.) Not another lecture, Master. At least not on the economics of politics. ItÕs too early in the morningÉ\\n\\nThe probe droid attaches a little tube to the hole in the window. The two deadly looking centipede-like kouhuns exit the tube, crawl through the blinds, and head toward the sleeping Padme. Artoo wakes up, and his lights go on. The kouhuns have scurried behind the bed on the opposite side from Artoo, however, and the little droid doesnÕt see them. Artoo looks around, makes a plaintive little sound, then shuts down again. The creatures scurry up onto the bedÉ\\n\\nINT. APARTMENT BUILDING, AMIDALAÕS APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM Ð NIGHT\\n\\nAnakin and Obi-Wan continue their conversation. \\n\\nANAKIN: And besides, youÕre generalizing. The Chancellor doesnÕt appear to be corrupt. \\nOBI-WAN: Palpatine is a politician. \\n\\nINT. APARTMENT BUILDING, AMIDALAÕS APARTMENT, BEDROOM Ð NIGHT\\n\\nThe kouhuns are only inches away from PadmeÕs face. They hiss, and wicked stinger tongues flicker from their mouthsÉ\\n\\nOBI-WAN: (V.O.) I have observed that he is very clever at following the passions and prejudices of the Senators.\\n\\nINT. APARTMENT BUILDING, AMIDALAÕS APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM Ð NIGHT\\n\\nANAKIN: I think heÕs a good man. My instincts are very positive aboutÉ thatÉ.\\n\\nA stunned look comes over AnakinÕs face. He looks sharply at Obi-Wan. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: I sense it too.\\n\\nINT. APARTMENT BUILDING, AMIDALAÕS APARTMENT, BEDROOM Ð NIGHT\\n\\nArtoo whoops in alarm and shines a light on the bed. \\n\\nObi-Wan and Anakin burst into the room. The kouhuns stand on their hind legs and hiss as Padme wakes up. Anakin throws himself in front of her, whacking in half the deadly creatures with his lightsaber.\\n\\nObi-Wan notices the droid outside the window and rushes straight at it, crashing through the blinds as he goes through the window. \\n\\nEXT. WINDOW LEDGE, APARTMENT BUILDING -- NIGHT\\n\\nObi-Wan flies through the glass window and flings himself at the probe droid, grabbing onto the deadly machine before it can flee. The probe droid sags under the weight of Obi-Wan, but continues to stay afloat and fly away with the Jedi hanging on for dear life, a hundred stories above the city.... \\n\\nINT. APARTMENT BUILDING, AMIDALAÕS APARTMENT -- NIGHT\\n\\nAnakin and Padme stare at the sight of Obi-Wan being carried off by the droid. Anakin turns to her. She pulls her nightdress around her shoulders.\\n\\nANAKIN: Stay here!\\n\\nAnakin rushes out the door as Captain Typho, Dorme and two guards rush in. \\n\\nDORME: Are you all right, MÕLady?\\n\\nPadme nods yes. \\n\\nEXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT -- NIGHT\\n\\nThe probe droid sends several protective electrical shocks across itsÕ surface, causing Obi-Wan to almost lose his grip. As they dart in and out of the speeder traffic, Obi-Wan disconnects a wire on the back of the droid. Its power shuts off! Obi-Wan and the droid drop like rocks. Obi-Wan realizes the error of his ways and quickly puts the wire back. The droidÕs systems light up again, and it takes off. The droid bumps against a wall, hoping to knock the Jedi loose. It moves behind a speeder afterburner to scorch him. It takes the Jedi wildly between buildings and finally skims a rooftop as Obi-Wan is forced to lift his legs, then run across the roof, tenaciously hanging on to the droid.  \\n\\nEXT. SENATE APARTMENTS Ð ENTRANCE -- NIGHT\\n\\nAnakin charges out of the building and runs to a line of parked speeders. He vaults into an open one and takes off, gunning it fast toward the line of speeder traffic high above. \\n\\nEXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT -- NIGHT \\n\\nThe droid moves into incoming air traffic, trying to knock Obi-Wan off. The Jedi desperately dodges incoming speeders. In one speeder, a Dug shakes its fist at him. \\n\\nDUG: JEDI POODOO!!\\n\\nThe droid heads for a dirty, beat-up speeder hidden in an alcove of a building about twenty stories up. When the pilot of the speeder, the scruffy bounty hunter Zam Wesell, sees the droid approach with Obi-Wan hanging on, she pulls a long rifle out of the speeder and starts to fire at the Jedi. Explosions burst all around Obi-Wan. \\n \\nOBI-WAN: I have a bad feeling about thisÉ\\n\\nZam grins and raises the rifle a bit higher. \\n\\nZAM: Dodge this. \\n\\nThe droid takes a direct hit and explodes. Zam runs to her speeder, jumps in, and takes off. Obi-Wan plummets fifty storiesÉ\\n\\nÉand clutches on to the back of a speeder! Groaning with effort, he flips over into the passenger seat and sits down next to the driver Ð Anakin.  \\n\\nANAKIN: (grinning) That was wacky! I almost lost you in the traffic! \\nOBI-WAN: What took you so long?!? \\nANAKIN: Oh you know Master, I couldnÕt find a speeder I really liked, with an open cockpitÉand with the right speed capabilitiesÉand then you know I had to get a really gonzo colorÉ\\n\\nThey zoom out in hot pursuit of Zam. Zam Wesell turns into incoming traffic, deliberately trying to throw the Jedi off her trail. Oncoming speeders honk and swerve to avoid her and the Jedi.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: (rolls his eyes) If youÕd spend as much time working on your saber skills as you do your wit, young Padawan, you would rival Master Yoda as a swordsman. \\nANAKIN: I thought I already did. \\nOBI-WAN: Only in your mind, my very young apprentice.\\n\\nAs this conversation is going on, Anakin deftly moves in and out of the oncoming traffic. Zam then flies her speeder sharply downward. Anakin steers his speeder down after her. The two speeders plunge straight down through moving lanes of air traffic. She finally levels off near a huge building; Anakin keeps shooting straight down, straight towards the roof. Obi-Wan tenses up as the building looms ever closer. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: Pull up, AnakinÉ PULL UP!!\\n\\nLaughing, Anakin finally pulls up just before he can smash into the building. The speeder misses the roof by inches. Obi-Wan is white as a sheet; AnakinÕs having the time of his life. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: You know I donÕt like it when you do that!!!\\nANAKIN: Sorry, Master. I forgot you donÕt like flying. \\nOBI-WAN: I donÕt mind flying Ð but what youÕre doing is suicide! \\n\\nAs he says this, Anakin barely avoids a commuter train. Obi-Wan jumps. They race at high speed across a wide, flat surface of the city planet. Zam weaves around flaming smokestacks at very close range, trying to set her pursuers on fire. \\n\\nThe chase heads for a power refinery. Pulling out her laser pistol, Zam shoots a power coupler causing voltage, like lightning, to jump across a gap from one coupler to another. But Anakin stays on course, piloting the speeder directly through the arc. Anakin and Obi-WanÕs bodies ripple with blue power. Huge electrical bolts shoot between the buildings as the speeders pass. \\n\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Anakin, how many times have I told you to stay away from power couplings?!? \\n\\nThe speeders finally fly out of the lightning. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: (sarcastic) Oh, that was goodÉ\\nANAKIN: That was crazy!!!\\n\\nThe Jedi tear after Zam. Zam goes up and down, through cross-traffic. There is a near miss as a speeder almost hits them. Zam turns down and left, into a transit tunnel built into a huge building. Anakin pulls up and to the right. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: Where are you going?!? He went that way!!  \\nANAKIN: Master, if we keep this chase going any longer, that creep is gonna end up deep fried! And personally, IÕd very much like to find out who he is and who heÕs working for!! This is a shortcutÉI think.  \\nOBI-WAN: What do you mean, ÔYou think?Õ\\n\\nZamÕs speeder shoots out of the other end of the transit tunnel. AnakinÕs speeder is nowhere in sight. Zam removes the veil from her face, smirking in satisfaction. \\n\\nAnakin turns up a side street, zooming up several small passageways. He comes to a stop, hovering about fifty stories up. Obi-Wan folds his arms and looks disapprovingly at the searching Anakin. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: Well, youÕve lost him. \\nANAKIN: (he doesnÕt mean it) IÕm deeply sorry, Master.\\n\\nAnakin looks around front and back. He spots something. He seems to start counting to himself as he watches something below approach.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: That was some shortcut, Anakin. He went completely the other way. Once again, youÕve proved --\\nANAKIN: If youÕll excuse me? \\n\\nSuddenly Anakin jumps out of the speeder!! Obi-Wan looks down and sees ZamÕs speeder about five stories below them cruising past. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: I hate it when he does that. \\n\\nAnakin miraculously lands on top of the bounty hunterÕs speeder. The speeder wobbles under the impact. Zam looks up and realizes what has happened. Suddenly, Zam just stops, and Anakin flies forward to the left front fork. Zam shoots at him with a laser pistol. There is a blast near AnakinÕs hand, which breaks off a piece of the speeder. Anakin slides to the right fork of the speeder, where Zam canÕt reach him. He scrambles to the top, holding onto an air scoop. Zam takes off, and Anakin slides to the back strut and almost slips off, but he manages to hang on. He works his way back to the speederÕs cockpit. Zam briefly changes back into her gray reptilian Clawdite form and sneers at him.\\n\\nObi-Wan has jumped into the driverÕs seat of his speeder and is deftly gaining on the rogue speeder. The two speeders dive through oncoming traffic and then through cross traffic. Soon Anakin is able to get hold of his lightsaber and starts to cut his way through the roof of the speeder. Zam takes out her laser pistol and starts firing at the helpless Jedi, knocking the sword out of AnakinÕs hand. Obi-Wan races under the speeder and catches the Jedi weapon in the passengerÕs seat. \\n\\nAnakin sticks his hand into the cockpit and grabs the gun in ZamÕs hand. They struggle for the weapon. It goes off, blowing the dashboard and speeder controls to bits. The speeder careens wildly out of control. Zam struggles to pull the speeder out of itsÕ nosedive. Obi-Wan gets slowed down by traffic and loses sight of the bounty hunterÕs speeder. \\n\\nJust as the speeder is about to nose dive into the ground, Zam pulls it out, and it slides hard on the pavement in a shower of sparks. Anakin goes flying into the street. \\n\\nEXT. ENTERTAINMENT STREET Ð NIGHT\\n\\nAnakin slowly pulls himself up, clutching his ribs painfully. Zam leaps out of the smoking speeder and rushes out into the crowd. Anakin moves to give chase into the very crowded street. \\n\\nItÕs the seedy underbelly of the city. Broken sidewalks, garish lights reflected in filthy puddles. ItÕs pretty crowded with various alien lowlifes, panhandling droids, and the occasional group of upper-class slummers. Anakin barges into several of them as he chases after the fleeing Zam. He loses the bounty hunter in the crowd, then sees her again. The young Jedi is having a very difficult time getting through the crowd. Obi-Wan lands the speeder in the nearby street. He gets out and runs through the crowd toward Anakin.\\n\\nAhead, Zam turns in through a door and disappears. A nightclub sign is flashing over the door. Anakin is just about to follow Zam into the nightclub when Obi-Wan catches up to him. \\n                                                            \\nOBI-WAN: Anakin!\\nANAKIN: She went into the club, Master --\\nOBI-WAN: Patience. Use the Force. Think.\\nANAKIN: Sorry, Master. \\nOBI-WAN: He went in there to hide, not to run. \\nANAKIN: Yes, Master. \\n\\nObi-Wan then offers Anakin his lightsaber.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Here. Next time try not to lose it. \\n\\nAnakin reaches for the lightsaber, but Obi-Wan holds it back. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: This weapon is your life. \\nANAKIN: (getting irritated) IÕve heard this lesson before Ð \\n\\nObi-Wan finally gives Anakin the lightsaber. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: But you haven\\'t learned anything, Anakin. \\n\\nObi-Wan releases hold of the lightsaber. \\n\\nANAKIN: I try, Master.\\n\\nObi-Wan walks ahead through the club entrance. Anakin follows him.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Why do I get the feeling youÕre going to be the death of me?\\n\\nINT. NIGHTCLUB (CORUSCANT) Ð NIGHT\\n\\nObi-Wan and Anakin enter the nightclub bar, and everyone stares at them. Anakin flinches at Obi-WanÕs last line, his eyes showing a bit of fear. \\n\\nANAKIN: DonÕt say that, Master. YouÕre the closest thing I have to a father. I love you, I donÕt want to cause you pain. \\nOBI-WAN: Then why donÕt you listen to me?!?\\nANAKIN: I am trying. \\n\\nThe two Jedi look around the crowded nightclub. Beings of all shapes, sizes and races are lounging around drinking and chatting. At the far wall, three giant screens are depicting sports events Ð a Podrace, droid football, and a nuna race. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: Can you see him? \\nANAKIN: I think he is a sheÉand I think sheÕs a changeling.  \\nOBI-WAN: In that case, be extra careful. (nods to the room) Go and find her.\\n\\nObi-Wan starts to move away. \\n\\nANAKIN: Where are you going, Master? \\nOBI-WAN: For a drink. \\n\\nObi-Wan heads for the bar. Anakin blinks in surprise, then moves into the room where alien faces look back at him with hostility, suspicion, and invitation as he moves among the tables. \\n\\nObi-Wan arrives at the bar. He nods to the bartender and points out a drink. \\n\\nCLOSE SHOT Ð Elsewhere in the room, someone unsnaps the safety on their holstered blasterÉ\\n\\nAs Obi-Wan picks up his blue drink, he is immediately disturbed by a young gravelly-voiced troublemaker named ELAN SLEAZEBAGGANO. \\n\\t                        \\nELAN: You want to buy some death sticks? \\n\\nWithout even looking at him, Obi-Wan casually waves his hand in front of ElanÕs face.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: You donÕt want to sell me death sticks. \\nELAN: I donÕt want to sell you death sticksÉ\\nOBI-WAN: You want to go home and rethink your life.\\nELAN: I want to go home and rethink my lifeÉ\\n\\nThe young thug wanders off, hypnotized. Obi-Wan downs his drink in one gulp. \\n\\nCLOSE SHOT: The blaster leaves itsÕ holster. Zam starts to move stealthily toward the barÉ\\n\\nAnakin continues to wander through the bar, searching the faces for the assassin. Obi-Wan signals to the bartender for another drink. Zam sneaks up behind him as he reaches for his drink, blaster raised and aiming at the JediÕs backÉ\\n\\nWith lightning speed, Obi-Wan whirls around, igniting his lightsaber, and chops ZamÕs blaster-arm clear across the room. Zam stumbles back with a gasp and lands on her rear, clutching her burnt stump. All talk in the room stops instantly. Anakin rushes over as Obi-Wan hauls up the injured Zam.\\n\\nANAKIN: (to the crowds) Easy. Jedi business Ð go back to your drinks.\\n\\nSlowly, the patrons sit down and resume their merriment. The performers onstage resume their show. The two Jedi drag Zam out of the room. \\n\\nEXT. ALLEY OUTSIDE NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT\\n\\nObi-Wan and Anakin carry Zam into an alley behind the nightclub and lower her to the ground. Obi-Wan starts to tend to her bleeding arm stump as she stares daggers at him and Anakin both. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: Do you know who it was you were trying to kill? \\n\\nShe winces in pain, then nods. \\n\\nZAM: It was the Senator from NabooÉ\\nOBI-WAN: And who hired you? \\n\\nShe stares coldly at him. \\n\\nZAM: It was just a job. \\nANAKIN: Who hired you?!? Tell us... \\nZAM: That SenatorÕs gonna die soon anyway. It wonÕt end with me. And the next one wonÕt make the same mistake I did. \\nOBI-WAN: (frowning at the stump) This woundÕs going to need treatmentÉ\\nANAKIN: Tell us Ð TELL US NOW!!\\n\\nShe stares glassy-eyed at Anakin, her lips twitching under AnakinÕs Force-powered demand. Obi-Wan stares at him in surprise. \\n\\nZAM: It was a bounty hunter called Ð \\n\\nFZZZT!! Zam suddenly seizes up, convulsing. The two Jedi look up at a WHOOSHING sound from above. A man, fully armored, his face hidden by a metal helmet, rises from a roof high above into the sky on a jetpack and flies out of sight. ZamÕs face begins to undulateÉthen settles into a gray reptilian form as Zam, with a last gurgling noise and eyeblink of surprise, sags in death. Obi-Wan looks down at the dead ZamÉand gingerly plucks a small metal dart out of the front of her neck. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: Toxic dartÉ\\n\\nHe looks back up at where the armored man had flown away from. \\n\\nWIPE TO:\\n\\nEXT. JEDI TEMPLE Ð DAY\\n\\nThe tall spires of the Jedi Temple stand out against the blue sky. \\n\\nINT. JEDI TEMPLE, COUNCIL CHAMBER -- DAY\\n\\nObi-Wan and Anakin stand in the center of a very worried Jedi Council. The Council members pass the toxic dart around each other. \\n\\nYODA: Track down this bounty hunter you must, Obi-Wan. \\nMACE WINDU: Most importantly, find out who heÕs working for. \\nOBI-WAN: What about Senator Amidala? She will still need protecting. \\nYODA: Handle that, your Padawan willÉ\\n\\nAnakin is overjoyed to hear this. \\n\\nMACE WINDU: Anakin, escort the Senator back to her home planet of Naboo. SheÕll be safer there. And donÕt use registered transport Ð travel as refugees. \\nANAKIN: As the leader of the opposition, it will be very difficult to get Senator Amidala to leave the capitol. \\nYODA: Until caught this killer is, our judgment she must respect. \\nMACE WINDU: Anakin, go to the Senate and ask Chancellor Palpatine to speak with her about this matter. Keep a low profile, Anakin Ð we want you off Coruscant before they can strike again. \\nANAKIN: Yes, Master. \\nMACE WINDU: You are dismissed. \\nYODA: May the Force be with you. \\n\\nThe two Jedi bow and leave the Council Chamber. \\n\\nINT. SENATE BUILDING, PALPATINEÕS OFFICE -- DAY\\n\\nAnakin joins Palpatine at the great window of his office, both staring side-by-side out at the vast city.\\n\\nPALPATINE: I will talk with her. Senator Amidala will not refuse an executive order. I know her well enough to assure you of that. \\nANAKIN: Thank you, Your Excellency. \\n\\nPalpatine smiles warmly. \\n\\nPALPATINE: And so, my young PadawanÉthey have finally given you an assignment. Your patience has paid off. \\nANAKIN: Your guidance, more than my patience. \\n\\nAnakin and Palpatine turn away from the windows and walk through the office towards the door. \\n\\nPALPATINE: You donÕt need guidance, Anakin. In time you will learn to trust your feelingsÉthen you will be invincible. I have said it many times, you are the most gifted Jedi I have ever met.\\nANAKIN: (pleased at the compliments) Thank you, your Excellency. \\nPALPATINE: I see you becoming the greatest of all the Jedi, Anakin. Even more powerful than Master Yoda. \\n\\nAnakinÕs head is swimming with the ChancellorÕs flattery. \\n\\nINT. JEDI TEMPLE, ATRIUM -- DAY\\n\\nObi-Wan walks alongside Mace Windu in one of the TempleÕs many vast corridors. Yoda floats alongside on a tiny repulsor chair.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I am concerned for my Padawan. He is not ready to be given this assignment on his own yet. \\nYODA: The Council is confident in itsÕ decision, Obi-Wan. \\nMACE WINDU: The boy has exceptional skills. \\nOBI-WAN: But he still has much to learn, Master. His abilities have made himÉ wellÉ. arrogant. \\nYODA: Yes, yes. A flaw more and more common among Jedi. HmmÉtoo sure of themselves they are. Even the older, more experienced ones. \\nMACE WINDU: Remember, Obi-Wan Ð if the prophecy is true, your apprentice is the only one who can bring the Force back into balance. \\nOBI-WAN: (foreboding) If he follows the right path. \\n\\nEXT. APARTMENT BUILDING -- DAY\\n\\nOutside Senator AmidalaÕs bedroom, a pair of floating droids fit a new window pane into place. \\n\\nINT. APARTMENT BUILDING, AMIDALAÕS APARTMENT Ð DAY\\n\\nAnakin looks on as Padme and Jar Jar talk, standing near the door of the anteroom to PadmeÕs bedroom. Dorme moves about, frantically packing luggage.  \\n\\nPADME: IÕm taking an extended leave of absence. It will be your responsibility to take my place in the Senate. Representative Binks, I know I can count on you.  \\nJAR JAR: You betcha yousa bottoms! \\nPADME: (grin) What?!? \\n\\nJar Jar cringes and clears his throat. \\n\\nJAR JAR: Mesa honored to be taken on dissa heavy burden. (pompously) Mesa accept dis with muyÉmuy humility anda --\\n\\nPadme cuts Jar Jar off in mid-speech with a hug and a kiss on the cheek. The Gungan blushes. \\n\\nPADME: Jar JarÉ I donÕt wish to hold you up. IÕm sure you have a great deal to do. \\nJAR JAR: Of course, MÕLady. \\n\\nThe Gungan bows, turns and leaves with a dazzling smile on his face. Padme walks briskly over to Anakin, in a very sour mood. \\n\\nPADME: I do not like this idea of hiding. \\nANAKIN: DonÕt worry. Now that the Council has ordered an investigation, it wonÕt take Master Obi-Wan long to find this bounty hunter.\\n\\nPadme crosses over to her closet and starts to throw clothes into a suitcase on her bed.\\n \\nPADME: (frustrated) IÕve havenÕt worked for a year to defeat the Military Creation Act to not be here when itsÕ fate is decided!!\\nANAKIN: Sometimes we have to let go of our pride and do what is requested of us. \\nPADME: PRIDE?!? Ani, youÕre young and you donÕt have a very firm grip on politics. I suggest you reserve your opinions for some other time!!\\n\\nAnakin is shaken by the hurt in PadmeÕs voice. \\n\\nANAKIN: Sorry, MÕLady. I was only trying to Ð \\nPADME: Ani, NO!\\nANAKIN: Please donÕt call me that. \\nPADME: What??\\nANAKIN: Ani. \\nPADME: IÕve always called you that. It is your name, isnÕt it? \\nANAKIN: ItÕs Anakin. When you say Ani itÕs like IÕm still a little boyÉ and IÕm not. \\nPADME: IÕm sorry -- Anakin. ItÕs impossible to deny that youÕveÉ(smiles as she looks him over) that youÕve grown up. \\n\\nAnakin becomes a little shy. \\n\\nANAKIN: Master Obi-Wan manages not to see it. \\n\\nHe crosses over to the new window as Padme continues to pack. He picks up a metal sphere and mentally raises it into the air, floating it around his arm with the Force. \\n\\nANAKIN: DonÕt get me wrong Ð Obi-Wan is a great mentor. As wise as Master Yoda and as powerful as Master Windu. I am truly thankful to be his apprentice. \\n\\n\\nHe puts the sphere back. \\n\\nANAKIN: OnlyÉ although IÕm a Padawan Learner, in some waysÉin a LOT of waysÉIÕm really ahead of him. IÕm ready for the trials, I KNOW I am! He knows it too! But he feels that IÕm too unpredictable. Other Jedi my age have gone through the trials and made it. I know I started my training late, but he wonÕt let me move on.\\n\\nPadme looks at him knowingly. \\n\\nPADME: That must be frustrating. \\nANAKIN: ItÕs worse. HeÕs overly critical, he never listens -- he doesnÕt understand!! ItÕs not fairÉ\\nPADME: Well, mentors have a way of seeing more of our faults than we would like. ItÕs the only way we grow.\\n\\nPadme fails to suppress a laugh, and shakes her head. Anakin scowls at her. \\n\\nPADME: IÕm sorry. You sounded exactly like that little boy I once knew, when he didnÕt get his way. \\nANAKIN: (pouting) IÕm not whining! IÕm not. \\n\\nPadme just smiles, as Dorme laughs in the background.   \\n\\nPADME: I didnÕt say it to hurt you.\\n\\nAnakin sighs and sits back on the bed. \\n \\nANAKIN: I knowÉ\\n\\nA brief pause, then Padme walks over to Anakin. \\n\\nPADME: AnakinÉ donÕt try to grow up too fast. \\n\\nAnakin gets up and meets her gaze, and the air between them becomes electric. They look deeply into each otherÕs eyes. \\n\\nANAKIN: But I am grown up. You said it yourself. \\n\\nPadme blinks first. \\n\\nPADME: Please donÕt look at me like that. \\nANAKIN: Why not? \\nPADME: Because I can see what youÕre thinking. \\nANAKIN: (half laugh) AhÉso you have Jedi powers too? \\n\\nDorme looks at Padme with growing concern. \\n\\nPADME: It makes me feel uncomfortable. \\nANAKIN: (he doesnÕt mean it) Sorry, MÕLady. \\n\\nPadme moves away from Anakin and continues packing. The Jedi apprentice has a sly smirk on his face. \\n\\nEXT. CORUSCANT, SPACEPORT FREIGHTER DOCKS, TRANSPORT BUS -- DAY\\n\\nA small airbus speeds toward the massive freighter docks of CoruscantÕs industrial area. The spaceport is bustling with activity. Transports of various sizes move supplies and passengers as giant floating cranes life cargo out of the starships. The bus stops before a huge, intergalactic freighter starship. It parks in the shadows of an overhang. \\n\\nINT. CORUSCANT, SPACEPORT FREIGHTER DOCKS, TRANSPORT BUS -- DAY\\n\\nPadme and Anakin, dressed in Outland peasant clothing, get up and head for the door where Captain Typho, Dorme and Obi-Wan are waiting to hand them their luggage. \\n\\nTYPHO: Be safe, MÕLady.\\nPADME: Thank you, Captain. Take good care of Dorme...the threatÕs on you two now. \\nDORME: HeÕll be safe with me.\\n\\nThe group laughs. Dorme starts to weep as Padme tenderly embraces her surviving handmaiden in a fond farewell. \\n\\nPADME: YouÕll be fine. \\nDORME: ItÕs not me, MÕLady. I worry about you. What if they realize youÕve left the capitolÉ? \\nPADME: Well, then my Jedi protector will have to prove how good he is. \\n\\nDorme laughs through her tears as Padme grins at Anakin. Obi-Wan notices the grin, and with a frown pulls Anakin aside and whispers. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: Anakin, you stay put on Naboo. Do not attract any attention to either yourself or the Senator. DonÕt do anything without first consulting either myself or the Council. \\nANAKIN: Yes, Master. \\n\\nObi-Wan looks at him uneasily, as if gauging his sincerity, but turns back to Padme. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: IÕll get to the bottom of this plot quickly, MÕLady. YouÕll be back here in no time. \\nPADME: IÕll be most grateful for your speed, Master Jedi. \\nANAKIN: ItÕs time to go. \\nPADME: I know. \\n\\nPadme gives Dorme one last hug, as Anakin picks up the luggage. The two exit the speeder bus, where Artoo is waiting for them. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: Anakin, may the Force be with you.\\nANAKIN: May the Force be with you, Master. \\n\\nThe two young people disappear into the spaceport with Artoo. \\n\\nPADME: Suddenly, IÕm afraidÉ\\nANAKIN: This is my first assignment on my own. I am too. \\n\\nPadme is wide-eyed, but recovers quickly. \\n\\nANAKIN: But donÕt worryÉwe have Artoo with us. \\n\\nArtoo beeps in the affirmative as Padme laughs. \\n\\nBack at the speeder taxi, Obi-Wan continues to stare with worry at the spaceport. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: I do hope he doesnÕt try anything foolish. \\nTYPHO: IÕd be more concerned about her doing something than him.  \\n\\nEXT. FREIGHTER DOCKS, CORUSCANT -- DAY\\n\\nThe freighter slowly rises from the dock area, and shoots into the crowded sky.\\n\\nINT. JEDI TEMPLE, MAIN HALLWAY - LATE DAY\\n\\nFrom high above, light streams down from the lofty ceilings. Obi-Wan crosses the floor of the great hallway, heading for the Analysis Rooms.\\n\\nINT. JEDI TEMPLE, ANALYSIS CUBICLES - LATE DAY\\n\\nObi-Wan walks past several glass cubicles where work is going on. He comes to an empty one and sits down in front of a console. A SP-4 ANALYSIS DROID comes to life, and a tray slides out of the console before the Jedi Master. \\n\\nSP-4: Place the subject for analysis on the sensor tray, please. \\n\\nObi-Wan puts the dart onto the tray, which retracts into the console. The droid activates the system, and a screen lights up in front of Obi-Wan. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: ItÕs a toxic dart. I need to know where it came from and who made it. \\nSP-4: One moment pleaseÉ \\n\\nDiagrams and scan data appear on the console in a blur of speed as SP-4 whirs quietly to itself. Obi-Wan waits. Finally the screen goes blank, and the tray slides back out. \\n\\nSP-4: Markings cannot be identified. As you can see on your screen, subject weapon does not exist in any known culture. Probably self-made by a warrior not associated with any known society. Stand away from the sensor tray please. \\nOBI-WAN: Excuse me? Could you try again, please?\\nSP-4: Master Jedi, our records are very thorough. They cover eighty percent of the galaxy. If I can\\'t tell you where it came from, nobody can.\\n\\nObi-Wan frowns in frustration as he takes the dart.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Thank you for your assistance. \\n\\nHe thinks for a moment, then brightens. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: I know who can identify thisÉ\\n\\nSP-4 gives an incredulous sniff as Obi-Wan walks off. \\n\\nIRIS IN:\\n\\nEXT. CORUSCANT, DOWNTOWN, BACK STREET -- MORNING\\n\\nObi-Wan walks down the street. It is a pretty tough part of town. Old buildings, warehouses, beat up speeders and transporter rigs thundering past. Above, the old elevated monospeed with occasional Òshiny freightersÓ hissing through. \\n\\nObi-Wan comes to a kind of alien diner. On the steamed-up windows it says ÒDexÕs Diner,Ó in alien lettering. He goes inside. \\n\\nINT. CORUSCANT, DEXÕS DINER -- MORNING\\n\\nA WAITRESS DROID, WA-7, is carrying plates of half-eaten food. There is a counter with stools and a line of booths along the wall by the window. A number of CUSTOMERS are eating Ð TOUGH-LOOKING WORKERS, FREIGHTER DRIVERS, ETC. The waitress droid looks up as Obi-Wan comes in.  \\n\\nWA-7: Can I help ya? \\nOBI-WAN: IÕm looking for Dexter. \\n\\nThe waitress droid approaches Obi-Wan. \\n\\nWA-7: Waddya want him for? \\nOBI-WAN: Relax Ð heÕs not in trouble. ItÕs personal. \\n\\nThere is a brief pause, then the droid goes to the open serving hatch behind the counter. \\n\\nWA-7: Someone to see ya, honey. (whisper) A Jedi by the looks of him. \\n\\nSteam billows out from the kitchen hatch behind the counter as a huge head pokes through. \\n\\nDEXTER JETTSTER: Obi-Wan!\\n\\nObi-Wan grins like a schoolboy. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: Hello, Dex. \\nDEXTER JETTSTER: Take a seat! IÕll be right with ya!\\n\\nObi-Wan sits in a booth. \\n\\nWA-7: You want a cup of java juice? \\nOBI-WAN: Oh yes, thank you.  \\n \\nThe waitress droid moves off as the door to the counter opens and DEXTER JETTSTER appears. He is big Ð bald and sweaty, old and alien. Not someone to tangle with. He arrives, beaming hugely, and hugs Obi-Wan with three of his four arms Ð his other arm pulls his pants up. \\n\\nDEXTER JETTSTER: Hey, olÕ buddy!\\nOBI-WAN: Hey, Dex. \\n\\nDexter eases himself into the seat opposite Obi-Wan. With his huge girth, he can just make it.  \\n\\nDEXTER JETTSTER: So, my friend. What can I do for ya? \\nOBI-WAN: You can tell me what this is. \\n\\nObi-Wan places the dart on the table between them. DexÕs eyes widen, and he puts down his mug before he drinks it. \\n\\nDEXTER JETTSTER: (softly) Wow, waddya knowÉ\\n\\nDexter picks up the dart delicately between his puffy fingers and peers at it.\\n\\nDEXTER JETTSTER: I ainÕt seen one of these since I was prospecting on Subterrel, beyond the Outer Rim! \\nOBI-WAN: Can you tell me where it came from? \\n\\nThe waitress droid rolls up with Obi-WanÕs drink. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: (as he takes the drink) Thank you. \\n\\nDexter grins and puts the dart down between them. \\n\\nDEXTER JETTSTER: I know exactly where itÕs from. This baby belongs to them cloners. What you got here is a Kamino saberdart. \\nOBI-WAN: Kamino saberdartÉI wonder why it didnÕt show up in the analysis archives?  \\nDEXTER JETTSTER: (indicates the dart) ItÕs these funny little cuts on the side that give it away. Those analysis droids youÕve got over there only focus on symbols, you know. Heh -- I should think that you Jedi would have more respect for the difference between knowledge andÉheh heh hehÉ wisdom.\\nOBI-WAN: (smirk) Well Dex, if droids could think, thereÕd be none of us here, would there?  \\n\\nThe two laugh. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: KaminoÉIÕm not familiar with it. Is it in the Republic? \\nDEXTER JETTSTER: No no, itÕs out beyond the Outer Rim. IÕd say about twelve parsecs outside the Rishi Maze towards the south. It should be easy to find, even for those droids in your archives. These, uhÉ Kaminoans keep to themselves. TheyÕre cloners. Damned good ones, too. \\n\\nObi-Wan picks up the dart, holding it midway between them. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: Cloners? Are they friendly?\\nDEXTER JETTSTER: (mysterious smile) Oh, depends. \\nOBI-WAN: Depends on what, Dex? \\n\\nDexterÕs grin grows wider. \\n\\nDEXTER JETTSTER: On how good your manners areÉand how big your, uh, pocketbook is...\\n\\nDex laughs heartily, as a smiling Obi-Wan looks down at the dart again. \\n\\nWIPE TO:\\n\\nINT. JEDI TEMPLE, JEDI HALL OF RECORDS Ð DAY\\n\\nThe bronze bust of an elderly bearded man stands among a line of other busts of Jedi in the Archive Room. Obi-Wan stops in front of it, studying the striking features of the chiseled face. On the walls, lighted computer panels seemed to stretch into infinity. Farther along the room in the background, five Jedi are seated at tables, studying archival material.\\n\\nObi-Wan studies the bust for a few moments before Madame JOCASTA NU, the Jedi Archivist, comes up and stands next to him. She is an elderly, frail-looking human Jedi dressed in a yellow and brown robe. SheÕs tough as old boots and smart as a whip. \\n\\nJOCASTA NU: Did you call for assistance? \\nOBI-WAN: (slightly distracted) YesÉyes, I did. \\n\\nJocasta Nu notices the bust Obi-WanÕs studying. \\n\\nJOCASTA NU: He has a powerful face, doesnÕt he? He was one of the most brilliant Jedi I have had the privilege of knowing. \\nOBI-WAN: I never understood why he quit. Only twenty Jedi have ever left the Order.\\nJOCASTA NU: (sigh) ÒThe Lost TwentyÓÉ Count Dooku was the most recent and the most painful. No one likes to talk about it. His leaving was a great loss to the order.\\nOBI-WAN: What happened? \\nJOCASTA NU: WellÉCount Dooku was always a bit out of step with the decisions of the Council. Much like your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn. \\nOBI-WAN: (surprised) Really? \\nJOCASTA NU: Oh, yes. They were alike in many ways. Very individual thinkers, idealistsÉ \\n\\nJocasta Nu gazes at the bust as she speaks. \\n\\nJOCASTA NU: He was always striving to become a more powerful Jedi. He wanted to be the best. With a lightsaber, in the old style of fencing, he had no match. His knowledge of the Force wasÉunique. (beat) In the end, I think he left because he lost faith in the Republic. He believed that politics were corrupt, and he felt the Jedi betrayed themselves by serving the politicians. He always had very high expectations of government. He disappeared for nine or ten years, then just showed up recently as the head of the separatist movement.\\nOBI-WAN: ItÕs very interesting. IÕm not sure I completely understand.\\nJOCASTA NU: Well, IÕm sure you didnÕt call me over here for a history lesson. Are you having a problem, Master Kenobi?\\n\\nObi-Wan leads Jocasta over to the computer terminal he was working on.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Yes. Um, IÕm trying to find a planetary system called Kamino. It doesnÕt show up in any of the archive charts. \\nJOCASTA NU: Kamino? ItÕs not a system IÕm familiar with. Let me seeÉ\\n\\nJocasta Nu leans over Obi-WanÕs shoulder, studying the screen closely. \\n\\nJOCASTA NU: Are you sure you have the right coordinates? \\nOBI-WAN: (nods) According to my information, it should appear in this quadrant here. Just south of the Rishi Maze. \\n\\nJocasta Nu types some commands on the keyboard, and frowns at what she sees. \\n\\nJOCASTA NU: No coordinates? It sounds like the sort of directions youÕd get from a street tout. Some old miner, or Furbog traderÉ\\nOBI-WAN: (smiles) All three, actually. \\nJOCASTA NU: Are you sure it exists?\\nOBI-WAN: Absolutely. \\n\\nJocasta grows more worried at what she sees on the monitor. \\n\\nJOCASTA NU: Let me do a gravitational scanÉ \\n\\nOn the monitor, a star map hologram comes up. Several items blink up for attention. \\n\\nJOCASTA NU: Hmm. There are some inconsistencies here. Maybe the planet youÕre seeking was destroyed. \\nOBI-WAN: WouldnÕt that be on record? \\nJOCASTA NU: It ought to be, unless it was very recent. (types some more, then shakes her head) I hate to say it, but it looks like the system youÕre searching for doesnÕt exist. \\nOBI-WAN: ImpossibleÉperhaps the archives are incomplete. \\nJOCASTA NU: (archly) The archives are comprehensive and totally secure, my young Jedi. One thing you may be absolutely sure of - if an item does not appear in our records, it does not exist!\\n\\nWith an arrogant sniff, Jocasta Nu turns and notices a young boy approach. She walks away from Obi-Wan and leaves with the youngster. Obi-Wan stares at her, then looks back to the map.\\n\\nEXT. SPACE, STARSHIP FREIGHTER \\n\\nThe massive, slow-moving Freighter moves through space.\\n\\nINT. STARFREIGHTER , STEERAGE HOLD -- DAY\\n\\nThe dark lower hold of the starfreighter is packed with emigrants of all shapes, sizes and races. Artoo rolls through the heavy crowds towards a food line at one end of the hold. With two tiny claws that shoot out from his side, Artoo picks up two empty bowls and joins the line. At the beginning of the line, the cooks are ladling mush into bowls for the passengers. \\n\\nSERVER DROID: Keep moving, keep movingÉ\\n\\nArtoo then moves down the line, extending a small straw into one of the tubs of mush at the bar. With the straw, the little droid sucks a huge amount of the mush. Another claw comes out of the droidÕs side and it takes up a few rolls of bread. The server droid glowers at little Artoo. \\n\\nSERVER DROID: HEY YOU!! NO DROIDS!! GET OUTTA HERE!!\\n\\nWith an ÒExcuse meÓ set of beeps, Artoo takes one last suck at the mush and rolls away from the line with the two bowls and the bread rolls as the server droid shouts after him.  \\n\\nThe little droid moves past groups of eating or sleeping emigrants including Sullustans, Aqualish, Ishi Tib and other species. He comes to where Anakin is sound asleep. The young Jedi seems to be having a nightmare and is very restless.\\n\\nANAKIN: nÉnoÉmom, noÉ\\n\\nThe Jedi apprentice is covered in sweat as he tosses and turns. Padme leans over him and starts to wipe the sweat away from his brow, and Anakin awakens with a start. \\n\\nANAKIN: Wha--??\\n\\nArtoo hands Padme the two bowls. Extending the straw again, it begins to dispense mush from itsÕ body into the bowls like a beer tap. \\n\\nPADME: You seemed to be having a nightmare. \\n\\nAnakin stares at Padme, wondering how much of his nightmare she overheard. She hands him one of the bowls and a bread roll. \\n\\nPADME: Are you hungry? \\nANAKIN: (quickly) Yeah. \\n\\nHe pulls himself up, and the two sit across the bunk and use it as a small table. \\n\\nANAKIN: Thanks. \\nPADME: Thank you, Artoo. \\n\\nArtoo beeps happily and rolls away. \\n\\nPADME: We went to lightspeed a while ago. \\nANAKIN: IÕm looking forward to seeing Naboo again. IÕve thought about it every day since I left. ItÕs by far the most beautiful place IÕve ever seenÉ\\n\\nHis eyes never leave Padme as he speaks. The intensity of his stare unnerves her, and she concentrates on her food. \\n\\nPADME: You were just a little boy then. It may not be as you remember it. Time changes perception. \\nANAKIN: Sometimes it does. Sometimes for the better. \\n\\nPadme is growing very uncomfortable with this talk. As Anakin eats, she tries to change the subject. \\n\\nPADME: It must be difficult, having sworn your life to the Jedi. Not being able to visit the places you likeÉor do the things you likeÉ\\nANAKIN: Éor be with the people that I love. \\nPADME: Are you allowed to love? I thought that was forbidden for a Jedi. \\nANAKIN: Attachment is forbidden. Possession is forbidden. Compassion Ð which I would define as unconditional love Ð is central to a JediÕs life. So you might say thatÉwe are encouraged to love. \\nPADME: (smiles wistfully) You have changed so muchÉ\\nANAKIN: You havenÕt changed a bit. YouÕre exactly the way I remember you in my dreams.\\n\\nPadme blushes. \\n\\nANAKIN: I doubt if Naboo has changed much either. \\nPADME: It hasnÕt Ð \\nANAKIN: (stepping over her words) I canÕt wait to breathe the sweet breeze that comes off the rolling hills. Whenever I try to visualize the Force, those hills are what I see. (pause) I love Naboo. \\n\\nAnother awkward moment. AnakinÕs words say he loves Naboo, but his intent stare at Padme says something else entirely. Padme again tries to change the topic. \\n\\nPADME: You were dreaming about your mother earlier, werenÕt you? \\nANAKIN: (quiet) Yes. ItÕs true. (looks down) I left Tatooine so long ago, my memory of her is fading. I donÕt want to lose it. Recently IÕve been seeing her in my dreams. Vivid dreams. (beat, then whisper) Scary dreams. I worry about herÉ\\n\\nPadme gives a small, sympathetic smile.\\n\\nPADME: IÕd be disappointed if you didnÕt. You didnÕt leave her in the best of circumstances. \\n\\nAnakin winces. Padme puts her hand on his forearm. \\n\\nPADME: Trust me, AnakinÉyou did the right thing in going. For yourself, but more importantly, for your mother. \\n\\nAnakin canÕt argue with that. \\n\\nINT. JEDI TEMPLE, MAIN HALLWAY Ð DAY\\n\\nObi-Wan walks through the main hallway of the Jedi Temple to the training area. \\n\\nINT. JEDI TEMPLE, TRAINING VERANDA -- DAY\\n\\nObi-Wan comes out onto the veranda and stops. He watches twenty or so four year olds of various races doing training exercises, supervised by Jedi Master Yoda. The younglings wear helmets over their eyes and try to strike little training droids with their miniature lightsabers. The droids dance in front of them. \\n\\nYODA: Reach out and sense the Force around you. Use your feelings, you must. \\n\\nYoda notices Obi-Wan and taps the ground with his cane. \\n\\nYODA: Younglings Ð Younglings, enough! A visitor we have. Welcome him.\\n\\nThe children take off their helmets and turn off their lightsabers. The training droids float up to the ceiling, out of sight. \\n\\nYODA: Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, meet the mighty Bear Clan.\\nCHILDREN: Hello, Master Obi-Wan!\\nOBI-WAN: Hello. (to Yoda) I am sorry to disturb you, Master.\\nYODA: What help can I be, Obi-Wan? Hmm? \\nOBI-WAN: IÕm looking for a planet described to me by an old friend. I trust him. But the systems donÕt show in the archive maps.\\nYODA: Hmm. Lost a planet Master Obi-Wan has. How embarrassing, how embarrassing...\\n\\nOne of the children smothers a giggle. \\n\\nYODA: Liam, the shades. An interesting puzzleÉ \\n\\nOne of the children, LIAM, closes the shades. \\n\\nYODA: Gather around the map reader. Clear your minds, and find Obi-WanÕs wayward planet we will. Bobby, the lights pleaseÉ\\n\\nBOBBY turns off the lights, casting the room into darkness. Yoda gathers the younglings around the map reader. The map reader is a small shaft with a hollow opening at the top. The children gather around it. Obi-Wan takes out a little glass ball and places it into the bowl. The window shades close darkening the room and the reader lights up, projecting the star map hologram into the room. The children laugh. Some of them reach up to try and touch the nebulae and stars. Obi-Wan walks into the display. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: (pointing) It ought to beÉhereÉ but it isnÕt. Gravity is pulling all the stars in the area towards this spot. \\nYODA: Most interestingÉ GravityÕs silhouette remains, but the star and all the planetsÉdisappeared, they have. How can this be?\\n\\nYoda turns to the class. \\n\\nYODA: Now younglingsÉin your mind, what is the first thing you see? An answer, hmm? A thought? Anyone? \\n\\nThere is a brief pause. Then a child puts its hand up. Yoda nods.\\n\\nJK BURTOLA: Master? Because someone erased it from the archive memory.\\nCHILDREN: ThatÕs right! Yes! ThatÕs what happened! Someone erased it!\\nMARI AMITHEST: (another of the children) If the planet blew up, the gravity would go away.\\nYODA: (chuckles) Truly wonderful, the mind of a child is. Uncluttered. The Padawan is right Ð go to the center of gravityÕs pull, and find your planet you will.\\n\\nYoda and Obi-Wan move away from the children. With a hand movement, Obi-Wan causes the star map to disappear. He uses the Force to call the glass ball back to his hand as the two walk into an adjoining room. \\n\\nYODA: HmmÉthe data must have been erased. \\nOBI-WAN: But Master Yoda, who could empty information from the archives? ThatÕs impossible, isnÕt it?\\nYODA: (frowns) Dangerous and disturbing this puzzle is. Only a Jedi could have erased those files. But who and whyÉharder to answer. Meditate on this, I will. May the Force be with you. \\n\\nObi-Wan bows and walks off as Yoda walks back toward the children.\\n\\nEXT. ANOTHER LANDING PLATFORM Ð DAY\\n\\nObi-WanÕs red-and-white Delta-7 starfighter is ready for takeoff. Obi-Wan and Mace Windu stand beside it.\\n\\nMACE WINDU: Be wary, the disturbance in the Force is growing stronger.\\n\\nObi-Wan nodsÉthen sighs with worry. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: Master, he should not have been given this assignment. IÕm afraid Anakin wonÕt be able to protect the Senator.\\nMACE WINDU: Why?\\nOBI-WAN: He has aÉ an emotional connection with her. ItÕs been there since he was a boy. Now he is confused, distracted...\\nMACE WINDU: Obi-Wan, you must have faith that he will take the right path.\\n\\nObi-Wan then climbs into the cockpit of his starfighter. Mace smiles and waves. \\n\\nMACE WINDU: May the Force be with you.\\nOBI-WAN: (to his droid) Set course for the hyperspace ring, Arfour. \\n\\nMace steps back as the Jedi Starfighter warms up and lifts off into the sky.\\n\\nWIPE TO:\\n\\nEXT. NABOO SPACEPORT  Ð DAY\\n\\nThe starfreighter lands in the giant port city of Theed. Among the departing passengers are Anakin and Padme (dressed as peasants) and Artoo. They head over to the main plaza where they board a speeder bus. \\n\\nEXT. NABOO PALACE, GRAND COURTYARD -- AFTERNOON\\n\\nThe speeder bus pulls up and stops at the Grand Courtyard of Theed, and Anakin, Padme and Artoo get out. Anakin stares out at the wide, beautiful courtyard in wonder. The great courtyard stretches before them, and they see the rose-colored domes of the palace on the far side. Artoo whistles. They pick up their gear and start to cross the courtyard. Artoo trundles behind them. \\n\\nANAKIN: If I grew up here, I donÕt think IÕd ever leave. \\nPADME: (laughs) I doubt that. \\nANAKIN: No, really. When I started my training, I was very homesick and very lonely. This city and my Mom were the only pleasant things I had to think aboutÉ (beat) The problem was, the more I thought about my Mom, the worse I felt. But I would feel better if I thought about the palace. The way it shimmers in the sunlight. The way the air always smells of flowersÉ\\nPADME: (wistful) Éand the soft sound of the distant waterfalls. The first time I saw the capitol, I was very young. IÕd never seen a waterfall before. I thought they were so beautifulÉI never dreamed one day IÕd live in the palace. \\nANAKIN: Well, tell me, did you dream of power and politics when you were a little girl?\\nPADME: (laughing) No! That was the last thing I thought of. But the more history I studied, the more I realized how much good politicians could do. After school I became a Senatorial advisor, with such a passion that before I knew it I was elected Queen. Partly because I scored so high on my education certificate, but for the most part it was my conviction that reform was possible. (beat) I wasnÕt the youngest Queen ever elected, but now that I think back on it, IÕm not sure I was old enough. IÕm not sure I was ready.\\nANAKIN: The people you served thought you did a good job. I heard they even tried to amend the Constitution so you could stay in office.\\n\\nPadme frowns at this. \\n\\nPADME: Popular rule is not democracy, Ani. It gives the people what they want, not what they need. And, truthfully, I was relieved when my two terms were up.\\n\\nShe looks down at the ground in contemplation. \\n \\nPADME: So were my parents. They worried about me during the blockade and couldnÕt wait for it all to be over. Actually, I was hoping to have a family by nowÉ (grins at Anakin) My sisters have the most amazing, wonderful kidsÉ but when the Queen asked me to serve as Senator, I couldnÕt refuse her.\\nANAKIN: I agree with her! I think the Republic needs youÉ IÕm glad that you chose to serve. I feel things are going to happen in our generation that will change the galaxy in profound ways.\\nPADME: I think so too.\\n\\nAnakin and Padme walk toward the palace. Artoo continues to follow. \\n\\nINT. NABOO PALACE, THRONE ROOM -- AFTERNOON\\n\\nQUEEN JAMILLIA is seated on the throne, flanked by SIO BIBBLE and a COUPLE OF ADVISORS. FOUR HANDMAIDENS stand close by, and GUARDS are at the doors. Outside the throne room, Artoo waits. \\n\\nQUEEN JAMILLIA: WeÕve been worried about you. (takes PadmeÕs hand) IÕm so glad youÕre safe, Padme. \\nPADME: Thank you, your Highness. I only wish I could have served you better by staying on Coruscant for the vote. \\nSIO BIBBLE: Supreme Chancellor Palpatine has explained it all. Given the circumstances, Senator, returning home was the only real choice you could have made. \\n\\nPadme gives Bibble a resigned nod. \\n\\nQUEEN JAMILLIA: How many systems have joined Count Dooku and the separatists?\\nPADME: Thousands. And more are leaving the Republic every day. If the Senate votes to create an army, IÕm sure itÕs going to push us into a civil war. \\n\\nBoth Jamillia and Sio are shaken by this. \\n\\nSIO BIBBLE: ItÕs unthinkable! There hasnÕt been a full-scale war since the formation of the Republic!\\nQUEEN JAMILLIA: Do you see any way, through negotiations, to bring the separatists back into the Republic?\\nPADME: Not if they feel threatened. The separatists donÕt have an army, but if they are provoked, they will move to defend themselves. IÕm sure of that. And with no time or money to build an army, my guess is they will turn to the Trade Federation or the Commerce Guilds for help.\\nQUEEN JAMILLIA: The armies of commerce! Why has nothing been done in the Senate to restrain them?!? \\nPADME: IÕm afraid that, despite the ChancellorÕs best efforts, there are still many bureaucrats, judges, and even Senators on the payrolls of the Guilds. \\nSIO BIBBLE: ItÕs outrageous that after all of those hearings and four trials in the Supreme Court, Nute Gunray is still the viceroy of the Trade Federation. I fear the Senate is powerless to resolve this crisis. Do those money mongers control everything?\\nQUEEN JAMILLIA: Remember, Counselor, the courts were able to reduce the FederationÕs armies. (beat) ThatÕs a move in the right direction.\\nPADME: (winces) There are rumors, Your Highness, that the Federation Army was not reduced as they were ordered.\\nANAKIN: The Jedi have not been allowed to investigate. It wasÉ considered to be too dangerous for the economy.\\nQUEEN JAMILLIA: (smiles) We must keep our faith in the Republic. \\n\\nThe Queen rises from her throne, and everyone else rises with her. She crosses over to Padme. \\n\\nQUEEN JAMILLIA: The day we stop believing democracy can work is the day we lose it.\\nPADME: LetÕs pray that day never comes.\\nQUEEN JAMILLIA: In the meantime, we must consider your own safety.\\n\\nAnakin, Padme, the Queen, and Bibble walk towards the open throne room doors. The handmaidens trail along behind them.\\n \\nSIO BIBBLE: What is your suggestion, Master Jedi? \\nPADME: Oh, AnakinÕs not a Jedi yet. HeÕs still a Padawan Learner. (To Jamillia) But I was thinking Ð \\nANAKIN: Hey, hold on a minuteÉ\\nPADME: (stern look at Anakin) Excuse me! (back to Jamillia) I was thinking I would stay in the Lake Country. There are some places up there that are very isolated. \\nANAKIN: Excuse me! I am in charge of security here, MÕLady!!\\n\\nThe tension between the two fills the room. Bibble and Jamillia look at each other with worry. \\n\\nPADME: Ani, my life is at risk. And this is my home. I know it very well, that is why weÕre here. I think it would be wise if you took advantage of my knowledge in this instance. \\n\\nAnakin takes a deep breath and forces a polite smile, though his eyes still blaze with anger. \\n\\nANAKIN: Sorry, MÕLady. \\nSIO BIBBLE: (half amused) SheÕs right. The Lake Country is the most remote part of Naboo. Not many people, and a clear view of the surrounding terrain. \\nQUEEN JAMILLIA: Perfect. ItÕs settled then. Padme, I had an audience with your father yesterday. I told him what was happening. He hopes you will visit your mother before you leave Ð your familyÕs very worried about youÉ\\nPADME: Thank you, your Highness. \\n\\nPadme looks worried as she and Jamillia walk out of the throne room and down a staircase. Anakin and Bibble follow them. \\n\\nEXT. THEED, RESIDENTIAL AREA, SIDE STREET Ð AFTERNOON\\n\\nPEOPLE are passing through a small street of Theed. OLD MEN are sunning themselves, WOMEN are gossiping, KIDS are playing. Anakin, Padme and Artoo turn onto a side street. Anakin is back in his Jedi robes and holding PadmeÕs luggage. Padme is wearing a beautiful simple dress. She stops, beaming.\\n\\nPADME: There\\'s my house!\\n\\nPadme starts forward; Anakin hangs back.\\n\\nPADME: What? Don\\'t say you\\'re shy!\\nANAKIN: (untruthfully) No, but I --\\n\\nSuddenly, there are shouts from two little girils, RYOO (age 6) and POOJA (age 4). They come running toward Padme.\\n\\nRYOO & POOJA: Aunt Padme!! Aunt Padme!!\\nPADME: Ryoo!! Pooja!!\\n\\nPadme scoops up Ryoo and Pooja and hugs them.\\n\\nPADME: I\\'m so happy to see you! This is Anakin. Anakin, this is Ryoo, and this is Pooja.\\n\\nAnakin and the girls say hello to each, both shyly. Then:\\n\\nPADME: Go wake up Artoo. \\nRYOO & POOJA: ARTOO!!\\n\\nAs they see the droid, they run up and hug him. Artoo whistles and beeps with happiness. Padme laughs, and she and Anakin go on toward the house. The girls stay and play with little Artoo.\\n\\nINT. PADME\\'S PARENTS\\' HOUSE, MAIN ROOM (NABOO) - AFTERNOON\\n\\nSOLA, Padme\\'s beautiful older sister, comes in from the kitchen carrying a big bowl of food.\\n\\nSOLA: (over her shoulder) They\\'re eating over at Jev Narran\\'s later, Mom. They just had a snack. They\\'ll be fine.\\n\\nSola puts the bowl down on the table, where Anakin, Padme and RUWEE NABERRIE (Padme\\'s father) are coming into the room.\\n\\nSOLA: Padme! (hugging her) YouÕre late. Mom was worried. \\nPADME: We walked. Anakin, this is my sister, Sola.\\nSOLA: Hello, Anakin.\\nANAKIN: Hello.\\n\\nSola sits, as JOBAL NABERRIE (Padme\\'s mother) comes in with a heaped bowl of steaming food.\\n\\nPADME: And this is my mother. \\nJOBAL: You\\'re just in time for dinner. I hope you\\'re hungry, Anakin.\\nANAKIN: A little.\\nPADME: He\\'s being polite, Mom. We\\'re starving.\\nRUWEE: (grinning) You came to the right place at the right time. Sit down, son.\\n\\nEveryone sits and starts passing food.\\n\\nJOBAL: (to Padme) Honey, it\\'s so good to see you safe. We were so worried.\\n\\nPadme gives her mother a dirty look. Ruwee smiles as he watches.\\n\\nRUWEE: Dear...\\nJOBAL: I know, I know... but I had to say it. Now it\\'s done.\\nSOLA: Well, this is exciting! Do you know, Anakin, you\\'re the first boyfriend my sister\\'s ever brought home?\\n\\nPadme blanches, and rolls her eyes at her sister. \\n\\nPADME: So-la!! He isn\\'t my boyfriend! He\\'s a Jedi assigned by the Senate to protect me.\\nJOVAL: A bodyguard?! Oh, Padme, they didn\\'t tell us it was that seriousÉ\\nPADME: It\\'s not, Mom, I promise. (glances at Jobal) Anyway, Anakin\\'s a friend. I\\'ve known him for years. Remember that little boy who was with the Jedi during the blockade crisis?\\n\\nThey nod.\\n\\nPADME: (wryly) He grew up.\\nJOBAL: Honey, when are you going to settle down? Haven\\'t you had enough of that life? I certainly have!\\nPADME: Mom, I\\'m not in any danger.\\nRUWEE: (to Anakin) Is she?\\n\\nAnakin hesitates.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nANAKIN: Yes. I\\'m afraid she is.\\nPADME: (quickly) But not much.\\n\\nEXT. PADME\\'S PARENTS\\' GARDEN - AFTERNOON\\n\\nAnakin and Ruwee are walking.\\n\\nRUWEE: Sometimes I wish I\\'d traveled more... but I must say, I\\'m happy here.\\nANAKIN: Padme tells me you teach at the university?\\nRUWEE: (nodding) Yes, and before that, I was a builder. I also worked for the Refugee Relief Movement when I was very young.\\nANAKIN: You seem quite interested in public service. \\nRUWEE: Naboo is generous. We have all that we want, all that we could want. Food is plentiful, climate is comfortable, surroundings are Ð \\nANAKIN: Beautiful. \\nRUWEE: Quite so. We are a very fortunate people, and we know it. That good fortune shouldnÕt be taken for granted, so we try to share and try to help. In doing so, we become something larger than ourselves, and more fulfilled than one can become from idly enjoying good fortune. \\nANAKIN: ItÕs the same with the Jedi, I suppose. WeÕve been given great gifts, and we train hard to make the most of them. And then we use our powers to try to help the galaxy, to make everything a little bit better. \\nRUWEE: And to make the things we love a little bit safer. \\n\\nAnakin smiles and nods. Ruwee looks at him with gratitude and respect. \\n\\nINT. NABERRIE LAKE RETREATÐ DINING ROOM -- DAY\\n\\nPadme, Sola, and Jobal are clearing the table. \\n\\nSOLA: Why haven\\'t you told us about him?\\nPADME: What\\'s there to talk about? He\\'s just a boy. \\nSOLA: A boy? Have you seen the way he looks at you?\\nPADME: Sola, stop it! \\nSOLA: It\\'s obvious he has feelings for you. Are you saying, little baby sister, that you haven\\'t noticed?\\nPADME: I\\'m not your baby sister, Sola. Anakin and I are friendsÉ our relationship is strictly professional. \\n\\nSola gives a knowing ÒSure it isÓ grin. \\n\\nPADME: Mom, would you tell her to stop it?\\nSOLA: (laughing) Well, maybe you haven\\'t noticed the way he looks at you. I think you\\'re afraid to.\\nPADME: Cut it out!!\\nJOBAL: Sola\\'s just concernedÉwe all are. \\nPADME: Oh, Mom, you\\'re impossible. What I\\'m doing is important.\\nJOBAL: You\\'ve done your service, Padme. It\\'s time you had a life of your own. You\\'re missing so much!\\n\\nEXT. PADME\\'S PARENTS\\' GARDEN (NABOO) - AFTERNOON\\n\\nRuwee pauses in his walk, and Anakin stops as well. \\n\\nRUWEE: Now tell me, sonÉhow serious is this thing? How much danger is my daughter really in? \\nANAKIN: (hesitantly) There have been two attempts on her life. Chances are thereÕll be more. \\n\\nRuwee is pained to hear this. \\n\\nANAKIN: My master is tracking down the assassins, IÕm sure heÕll find out who they are. This situation wonÕt last long. \\n\\nRuwee nods, sadly. \\n\\nRUWEE: I donÕt want anything to happen to herÉ\\nANAKIN: I donÕt either.  \\n\\nINT. NABERRIE LAKE RETREATÐ DINING ROOM -- DAY\\n\\nPadme and Sola are now alone in the room. Padme stares at her older sister with some exasperation. \\n\\nSOLA: What? \\nPADME: Why do you keep saying such things about me and Anakin? \\nSOLA: Because itÕs obvious. You see it Ð you canÕt deny it. \\n\\nPadme sighs. \\n\\nSOLA: I thought Jedi werenÕt supposed to think such things. You think more like a Jedi than he does Ð and you shouldnÕt. \\nPADME: What do you mean? \\nSOLA: YouÕre so tied up in your responsibilities that you donÕt give any weight to your desires. \\nPADME: You donÕt know how I feel about Anakin. \\nSOLA: And neither do you Ð because you wonÕt let yourself think about it. ItÕs funny Ð you act as if youÕre prohibited and youÕre not, while Anakin acts as if heÕs under no such prohibitions, and he is! \\nPADME: YouÕre way ahead of everything! Anakin and I have only been together for a few days Ð before that, I hadnÕt seen him in a decade! \\n\\nSola shrugs and puts an arm around PadmeÕs shoulder. \\n\\nSOLA: I know how he feels. And so do you. \\n\\nPadme gazes down at the floor, troubled. Sola lifts her chin and makes Padme face her. \\n\\nSOLA: It frightens you. What are you afraid of? Are you afraid of his feelingsÉor of your own? (beat) YouÕre right, I donÕt know how you feel. But I suspect that itÕs something new to you. Something scaryÉbut something wonderful. \\n\\nPadme canÕt answer that.\\n\\nINT. PADME\\'S PARENTS\\' HOUSE, PADME\\'S ROOM - AFTERNOON\\n\\nPadme throws some things into a bag.\\n\\nPADME: Don\\'t worry, this won\\'t take long.\\nANAKIN: I just want to get there before dark.\\n\\nPadme goes on packing, and Anakin looks around the room.\\n\\nANAKIN: You still live at home.\\nPADME: I move around so much, I\\'ve never had a place of my own. Official residences have no warmth. I feel good here. I feel at home.\\nANAKIN: I never had a real home. Home was always where my mom was.\\n\\nAnakin picks up a framed hologram and shows it to her.\\n\\nANAKIN: Is this you?\\n\\nThe hologram shows Padme at age seven or eight surrounded by forty or fifty little green creatures. She is holding one in her arms. They are all smiling hugely.\\n\\nPADME: That was when I went with a relief group to Shadda-Bi-Boran. Their sun was imploding, and the planet was dying. I was helping to relocate the children. See that little one I\\'m holding? His name was N\\'a-kee-tula, which means Òsweetheart.Ó He was so full of life... All those kids were. (somber) I did everything I could to save him, but he died... they all did. They were never able to adapt. To live off their native planet.\\n\\nAnakin picks up another hologram. It shows Padme at age ten or eleven. She is wearing official robes and standing between two robed legislators. Her expression is severe.\\n\\nPADME: My first day as an Apprentice Legislator. Notice the difference?\\n\\nPadme pulls a face, and Anakin grins. She continues packing. Anakin sets the two holograms down side by side - the beaming little girl, and the stern, unsmiling adolescent.\\n\\nWIPE TO: \\n\\nEXT. SPACE Ð NEAR KAMINO\\n\\nThe view is just like the star map hologram, plus the storm-shrouded planet of Kamino, which is exactly where it ought to be. Obi-Wan\\'s Starship leaps out of hyperspace and disengages from the hyperspace transport ring. The starship, painted red-and-white and wedge-shaped, flies OVER CAMERA and heads down toward the planet.\\n\\nINT. COCKPIT, JEDI FIGHTER, SPACE\\n\\nObi-Wan sits in the starshipÕs cockpit, wearing a headset. He studies the console readouts. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: There it is, Arfour, right where it should be. Our missing planet, Kamino. Those files were altered. \\n\\nOn the side of the ship, a red-and-white ARFOUR DROID beeps in worry. \\n\\nEXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) Ð DAY\\n\\nHeavy rains and hard-driving winds lash the platform as Obi-WanÕs Starship approaches. The huge, ultra-modern city of Tipoca rests on great stilts that keep it above the pounding and ever-present waves that cover the surface of this watery world. \\n\\nThe Starfighter lands. Obi-Wan gets out and makes his way through the howling wind toward a tower on the far side of the platform. A door slides open. A shaft of brilliant light pierces the swirling rain. Obi-Wan passes through it and goes inside. \\n\\nINT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR ENTRANCE -- DAY \\n\\nBrilliant white light. Obi-Wan pushes the soaking hood from his face. \\n\\nTAUN WE: Master Jedi, so good to see you. Welcome to Tipoca City.\\n\\nOBI-WAN wipes the rain from his face and blinks in surprise at a tall, pasty-white alien named TAUN WE. She has large almond shaped eyes, and speaks with a slow, melodic singsong voice.\\n\\nTAUN WE: Everything is ready. The Prime Minister is expecting you.\\nOBI-WAN: (warily) I\\'m expected?!?\\nTAUN WE: Of course! He is anxious to meet you. After all these years, we were beginning to think you weren\\'t coming. Now please, this wayÉ\\n\\nINT. TIPOCA CITY, PRIME MINISTERÕS OFFICE Ð DAY\\n\\nThe door slides open. Obi-Wan and Taun We enter and cross to where LAMA SU rises smiling from his chair, which, like all the furniture on Kamino, seems made out of pure light.\\n\\nTAUN WE: May I present Lama Su, Prime Minister of Kamino. And this is Master Jedi Ð \\nOBI-WAN: Obi-Wan Kenobi. \\nLAMA SU: PleaseÉ\\n\\nLama Su gestures to a seat, which Obi-Wan does not take. Lama Su sits as well, while Taun We hovers beside him. The room is bathed in brilliant white light. The whole place is ultra high-tech. \\n\\nLAMA SU: I trust you are going to enjoy your stay. We are most happy you have arrived at the best part of the season. \\nOBI-WAN: You make me feel most welcome. \\nLAMA SU: (indicates the chair again) PleaseÉ? \\n\\nObi-Wan finally sits down.\\n\\nLAMA SU: And now to business: You will be delighted to hear that we are on schedule. Two hundred thousand units are ready, with a million more well on the way. \\n\\nObi-Wan is lost, but improvises as best he can. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: ThatÕsÉgood news. \\nLAMU SU: Please tell your Master Sifo-Dyas that his order will be met on time and in full. He is well, I hope.\\nOBI-WAN: IÕm sorry? Master Ð ?\\nLAMU SU: Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas is still a leading member of the Jedi Council, is he not?\\n\\nObi-Wan is visibly puzzled. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: Master Sifo-Dyas was killed almost ten years ago. \\nLAMA SU: Oh. IÕm so sorry to hear that. But IÕm sure he would have been proud of the army weÕve built for him. \\nOBI-WAN: The armyÉ!?\\nLAMA SU: Yes Ð a clone army. And I must say, one of the finest weÕve ever created. \\nOBI-WAN: (thinking furiously) Tell me, Prime MinisterÉ when my Master first contacted you about the army, did-did he say who it was for? \\nLAMA SU: Of course he did. The army is for the Republic. \\n\\nObi-Wan is visibly rocked by this. Lama Su stands up. \\n\\nLAMA SU: But you must be anxious to inspect the units for yourself. \\nOBI-WAN: (grins and shrugs) ThatÕs why IÕm here. \\n\\nObi-Wan and Lama Su rise and walk toward the door. \\n\\nEXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, WATER SPEEDER, LANDING PLATFORM - LATE AFTERNOON\\n\\nA water speeder driven by PADDY ACCU, the retreat caretaker, docks at an island landing platform. Anakin and Padme disembark the water speeder at the base of a lodge rising on the beautiful island in the middle of the lake. \\n\\nEXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, GARDEN TERRACE -- LATE AFTERNOON\\n\\nAnakin and Padme walk up the stairs from where the water speeder is parked onto the garden terrace overlooking a lovely garden. Behind them, Paddy Accu follows. Anakin and Padme stop at the balustrade. Padme looks out across the garden to the shimmering lake and the mountains rising beyond. Anakin looks at her. \\n\\nPADME: When I was in Level Three, we used to come here for school retreat. See that island? We used to swim there every day. I love the water. \\nANAKIN: I do too. I guess it comes from growing up on a desert planet.\\n\\nPadme suddenly becomes aware that Anakin is looking only at her. \\n\\nPADME: We used to lie out on the sand and let the sun dry us, and try to guess the names of the birds singing.\\nANAKIN: I donÕt like sand. ItÕs coarse and rough and irritating, and it gets everywhere. Not like hereÉ\\n\\nAnakin touches PadmeÕs arm, caressing it. PadmeÕs intensely uncomfortable, but starting to like the attention in spite of herself. \\n\\nANAKIN: Here everythingÕs softÉ and smoothÉ\\nPADME: There was a very old man who lived on the island. He used to make glass out of sand Ð and vases and necklaces out of the glass. They were magical.\\nANAKIN: Everything here is magical.\\n\\nPadme keeps trying to avoid his gaze, but Anakin keeps bringing her eyes to meet his. \\n\\nPADME: You could look into the glass and see the water. The way it ripples and moves. It looked so realÉ but it wasnÕt.\\nANAKIN: SometimesÉwhen you believe something to be realÉ it becomes real. \\n\\nAnakin flashes a dazzling, heart-melting smile. But Padme forces herself to continue with her story.\\n\\nPADME: I used to thinkÉ if you looked too deeply into glassÉyou would lose yourself. \\nANAKIN: I think itÕs true. \\n\\nSlowly, tenderly, he kisses her. She doesnÕt resistÉ at first. She pulls away after a moment. \\n\\nPADME: No. I shouldnÕt have done thatÉ\\nANAKIN: IÕm sorryÉ\\n\\nHe stares at the lake, a bewildered Òwhat did I do wrongÓ look on his face. \\n\\nINT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, HATCHERY Ð DAY\\n\\nObi-Wan is led by Lama Su and Taun We through a transparent glass tunnel to a vast clone hatchery all around them, where thousands upon thousands of translucent tubes can be seen, sticking out from the floor and ceiling at all angles, and an embryonic form in each of them. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: Very impressive.\\nLAMA SU: IÕd hoped you would be pleased. Clones can think creatively. YouÕll find that they are immensely superior to droids.\\n\\nObi-Wan gazes at the nearest embryos.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: How many are thereÉ? \\nLAMA SU: We have several hatcheries throughout the city. This, of course, is the most crucial phase Ð though with our techniques, we expect a survival rate of over ninety percent. Every so often, an entire batch will develop aÉan issue, but we expect production to remain steady, and with our accelerated growth methods, these before you will be fully matured and ready for battle in just over a decade. \\n\\nObi-Wan canÕt suppress a shudder. Lama Su gestures far below the tunnel at a distant classroom. Inside, a group of small identical ten-year-old boys in blue outfits sit at desks and rapidly move complex puzzles into completion in mere seconds. There are patches on each of the childrenÕs shoulders. \\n\\nLAMA SU: We take great pride in our combat education and training programs. This group was created about five years ago. \\nOBI-WAN: You mentioned growth acceleration...\\nLAMA SU: Oh yes, it\\'s essential. Otherwise, a mature clone would take a lifetime to grow. Now, we can do it in half the time. The items you will soon see on the parade ground were started ten years ago, when Sifo-Dyas first placed the order, and they\\'re already mature...\\n\\nLama Su points down at a large eating area. Seated and eating at tables are HUNDREDS OF CLONES who look exactly alike, all physically about twenty years old, dressed in red outfits. They also have patches on their shoulders.  \\n\\nOBI-WAN: I see. \\nLAMA SU: YouÕll find they are totally obedient, taking any order without question. We modified their genetic structure to make them less independent than the original host. \\n\\nThe trio continue to walk down the glass tunnel. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: And who was the original host?\\nLAMA SU: A bounty hunter called Jango Fett. We felt a Jedi would be the perfect choice, but Sifo-Dyas handpicked Jango Fett himself.\\n\\nObi-Wan notes the words Òbounty hunter,Ó but keeps his expression neutral. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: And where is this bounty hunter now?\\nLAMA SU: Oh, we keep him here. After a few hundred thousand clones, the genetic pattern starts to fade, so we take a fresh supply. He lives here, but he\\'s free to come and go as he pleases.\\n\\nThe tour continues through a long corridor filled with narrow, transparent tubes into which clones are climbing. Once in the tube, the clone goes to sleep. The other side of the tunnel looks out upon a vast training area when clones of various ages go through rigorous martial arts matches.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Very disciplined. \\nLAMA SU: That is the key. Disciplined, and yet able to think creatively. It is a mighty combination. Sifo-Dyas explained to us the Jedi aversion to leading droids. He told us Jedi could only command an army of life forms. \\nOBI-WAN: So this Jango Fett willingly lives here? \\nLAMA SU: The choice is his alone. Apart from his pay, which is considerable, Fett demanded only one thing - an unaltered clone for himself. Curious, isn\\'t it?\\nOBI-WAN: Unaltered?\\n\\nThe tour now moves over a vast grouping of lines. Several hundred adult clones, now in white armor, move to a conveyor belt where white helmets are rolling along. Each clone takes a helmet, dons it, and moves out. \\n\\nLAMA SU: Pure genetic replication. No tampering with the structure to make it more docile... and no growth acceleration...\\nOBI-WAN: I should very much like to meet this Jango Fett.\\nTAUN WE: I would be very happy to arrange it for you.\\n\\nFinally the tunnel ends, and Obi-Wan, Lama Su and Taun We come out onto a balcony. Below is a huge parade ground. The rain and wind are brutal. THOUSANDS OF CLONE TROOPERS can be seen below, and each are wielding a blaster rifle. They move in perfect military formation, entire formations moving as one, in a stunning parade of might despite the pouring rain. \\n\\nLAMA SU: (beaming) Magnificent, arenÕt they? \\n\\nObi-Wan nods slowly. He is both awed and terrified at the sight before him.\\n\\nEXT. NABOO, MOUNTAIN MEADOW Ð LATE AFTERNOON\\n\\nPadme and Anakin are in the middle of an idyllic hilly meadow, its lush grasses sprinkled with flowers. At a distance, a herd of SHAAKS graze contentedly. Beyond is the shimmering expanse of waterfalls of the lake. Several other lakes stretch to the horizon. The air is full of little floating puffballs. They sit on the grass, in a playful, coy mood, talking. Padme is picking flowers. \\n\\nPADME: I donÕt knowÉ\\nANAKIN: Sure you do. You just donÕt want to tell me. \\nPADME: Are you going to use one of your Jedi mind tricks on me?\\nANAKIN: They only work on the weak-minded. You are anything but weak-minded.\\nPADME: All rightÉI was twelve. His name was Palo. We were both in the Legislative Youth Program. He was a few years older than IÉ very cute. Dark curly hair. Dreamy eyes. \\nANAKIN: All right, I get the pictureÉwhatever happened to him? \\nPADME: I went into public service. He went on to become an artist. \\nANAKIN: Maybe he was the smart one. \\nPADME: (thoughtful) You really donÕt like politicians, do you? \\n\\nAnakin shrugs. \\n\\nANAKIN: I like two or three, but IÕm not really sure about one of them. \\n\\nPadme giggles. \\n\\nANAKIN: I donÕt think the system works. \\nPADME: How would you have it work? \\nANAKIN: We need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problem, agree what\\'s in the best interests of all the people, and then do it.\\nPADME: ThatÕs exactly what we do. Th-the trouble is that people don\\'t always agree. In fact, they hardly ever do.\\nANAKIN: Then they should be made to.\\nPADME: By whom? Who\\'s going to make them?\\nANAKIN: I don\\'t know. Someone.\\t\\nPADME: You?\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nANAKIN: Of course not me.\\nPADME: But someone.\\nANAKIN: Someone wise.\\t\\nPADME: Sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me.\\nANAKIN: WellÉ if it worksÉ\\n\\nShe stares at him, confused. Anakin canÕt keep a straight face, and finally grins. Padme busts out laughing. \\n\\nPADME: (laughs) YouÕre making fun of me! \\nANAKIN: (grinning) Oh no, IÕd be much too frightened to tease a Senator.\\nPADME: YouÕre so bad! \\n\\nShe picks up a piece of fruit and throws it at him. He catches it. Padme throws two more, and he catches them both. \\n\\nANAKIN: YouÕre always so seriousÉ\\nPADME: IÕm so serious?!?\\n\\nAnakin then starts to juggle the fruit. Padme laughs and throws more fruit at him. He manages to juggle them too. She throws more and more until there are too many, and he loses control and ducks, letting food fall on his head. They both laugh.\\n\\nAnakin then gets up and stands in front of a Shaak, yelling at it and waving his arms. Padme starts laughing as Anakin runs in circles, chased by the Shaak.\\n\\nEXT. NABOO, MOUNTAIN MEADOW, LATE AFTERNOON\\n\\nThe Shaak crosses in front of Padme. Anakin is now standing on top of it, riding on its back. The Shaak bucks, and Anakin falls off. Padme laughs even harder. Anakin lies still, face down in the grass. PadmeÕs smile fades. \\n\\nPADME: Ani Ð ANI!! Are you all right? \\n\\nShe jumps up and runs to where Anakin is lying and turns him over. He is laughing at her. She yelps in mock fury and takes a swing at him. He catches her arm. She struggles. They roll over in the grass. They stop with Padme lying on top of Anakin. Suddenly, they become aware of the contact between them. They let go of each other quickly and sit up, looking away.\\n\\nAnakin stands up and holds out his hand to her. She takes it. He pulls her up. And now they are easy together, not self-conscious any more. Padme scrambles up onto the Shaak behind Anakin. She puts her arms around his waist and leans against his back. Anakin digs his heels in. The Shaak starts forward, and they ride away.\\n\\nEXT. TIPOCA CITY (RAINSTORM) Ð DAY\\n\\nRain lashes the city. Below, mighty waves pound the stilts, breaking almost to the height of the platforms. A large avian carrying a rain-soaked rider bursts out of the sea and flies above the water toward a floating city. \\n\\nINT. JANGO FETTÕS APARTMENT (KAMINO) Ð DAY\\n\\nObi-Wan and Taun We arrive at an apartment. Taun We waves her hand, and a muted bell rings. As they wait, Obi-Wan notes the lock mechanism on the door. Then the door slides open to reveal a young ten-year-old boy identical to the ones in the classroom before Ð identical, that is, except for his sharper, more aware expression.\\n\\nTAUN WE: Boba, is your father here?\\n\\nThere is a brief pause.\\n\\nBOBA FETT: Yep. \\nTAUN WE: May we see him?\\nBOBA FETT: Sure.\\n\\nAnother brief pause, then Boba Fett steps aside, and Taun We and Obi-Wan go through.\\n\\nINT. TIPOCA CITY, FETT APARTMENT -- DAY\\n\\nObi-Wan, Taun We and Boba Fett enter the apartment. Obi-Wan looks around the room. \\n\\nBOBA FETT: Dad, Taun WeÕs here! \\n\\nJANGO FETT comes in from the bedroom. He wears a jumpsuit. He is unshaven and mean looking, his face pitted with the scars of old wounds. There are a couple of weird tattoos on his muscular forearms.  He eyes Obi-Wan with suspicion.\\n\\nTAUN WE: Jango, welcome back. Was your trip productive? \\nJANGO FETT: Fairly. \\n\\nObi-Wan and Jango Fett size each other up. Boba notices this and studies the two closely. \\n\\nTAUN WE: This is Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi. HeÕs come to check on our progress. \\nJANGO FETT: That rightÉ? \\n\\nJango FettÕs eyes fix Obi-Wan coldly. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: Your clones are very impressive. You must be very proud. \\nJANGO FETT: (shrug) IÕm just a simple man trying to make my way in the universe, Master Jedi. \\nOBI-WAN: ArenÕt we all? \\n\\nObi-Wan finally gives up the staredown and looks around the apartment. His gaze falls upon the half-open bedroom doorÉand beyond it, scraps of some very familiar body armor. Jango smoothly puts himself between Obi-Wan and the door. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: (pointedly) Ever made your way as far into the interior as Coruscant? \\nJANGO FETT: Once or twice. \\nOBI-WAN: Recently? \\nJANGO FETT: Possibly. \\n\\nJangoÕs maintaining a perfect poker face, with a hint of a smile. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: Then you must know Master Sifo-Dyas?\\nJANGO FETT: (in Huttese) Boba, close the door. (back to Obi-Wan) Master who? \\n\\nBoba Fett moves in to close the bedroom door. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: Sifo-Dyas. Is he not the Jedi who hired you for this job? \\nJANGO FETT: Never heard of him. \\nOBI-WAN: Really. \\nJANGO FETT: I was recruited by a man called Tyranus, on one of the moons of Bogden. \\nOBI-WAN: No? I thought --\\nTAUN WE: Sifo-Dyas told us to expect him, and he showed up just when your Jedi Master said he would. We have kept the JediÕs involvement a secret until your arrival, just as your master requestedÉ\\n\\nObi-Wan is even more concerned at this. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: CuriousÉ\\nJANGO FETT: Do you like your army?\\nOBI-WAN: I look forward to seeing them in action.  \\nJANGO FETT: (smirk) TheyÕll do their job well, IÕll guarantee that. \\nOBI-WAN: Thank you for your time, Jango. \\nJANGO FETT: Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi. \\n\\nObi-Wan and Taun We leave. The door slides closed. Jango looks over at Boba thoughtfully. \\n\\nBOBA FETT: What is it, Dad?\\nJANGO FETT: Pack your things. WeÕre leaving. \\n\\nBoba starts to reply Ð \\n\\nJANGO FETT: NOW!!\\n\\nBoba almost trips over himself rushing into the bedroom. \\n\\nEXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LOUNGE -- LATE AFTERNOON\\n\\nThe setting sun touches the mountain peaks. The lake glows in the rose-tinted light. Floating lamps glean softly like jewels at the lodge. \\n\\nINT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, DINING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON\\n\\nNANDI places dessert in front of Padme. TECKLA does the same for Anakin. The dessert is some kind of fruit. \\n\\nANAKIN: And when I got to them, we went intoÉaggressive negotiations. (to Teckla) Thank you. \\nPADME: ÒAggressive negotiations.Ó WhatÕs that? \\nANAKIN: Uh, wellÉnegotiations with a lightsaber. \\nPADME: (laughing) Oh. \\n\\nPadme picks up her fork and goes to spear a piece, but it moves! She frowns and tries again - the fruit moves. She looks up at Anakin. His eyes are focused on his plate.\\n\\nPADME: You did that?\\n\\nAnakin looks up - wide-eyed innocence.\\n\\nANAKIN: What?\\n\\nPadme scowls at him and jabs at the fruit - Anakin subtly moves his hand and it lifts up from the plate and hovers in front of her!\\n\\nPADME: That! Now stop it!\\n\\nThe two laugh. She reaches out for the fruit - it loops.\\n\\nPADME: Anakin!!\\n\\nAnakin moves his fingers. The fruit flies into his hand.\\n\\nANAKIN: I\\'m not really supposed to do that... for fun, I mean. If Master Obi-Wan caught me doing this, he\\'d be very grumpy.\\n\\nGrinning, Anakin cuts the fruit into several pieces and sends one back to Padme. She spears it out of the air with her fork and takes a bite out of it. A warm, childlike smile brightens AnakinÕs face. \\n\\nINT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, FIREPLACE ALCOVE - TWILIGHT\\n\\nA fire blazes in the open hearth. Padme is sitting in front of it, gazing at the flames.\\n\\nShe looks up as Anakin arrives. She makes room for him. Brief pause.\\n\\nANAKIN: May I tell you something?\\nPADME: I don\\'t know.\\nANAKIN: Then how can I tell you?\\nPADME: Maybe you should use your Jedi intuition.\\nANAKIN: It doesn\\'t work around you. My mind is always a muddle... I can only think of you.\\nPADME: (sighs) Anakin, no...\\n\\nAnakin canÕt stop now. The words rush out in a torrent. \\n\\nANAKIN: From the moment I met you, all those years ago, not a day has gone by when I haven\\'t thought of you. And now that I\\'m with you again, I\\'m in agony. \\n\\nAnakinÕs voice begins to quiver. \\n\\nANAKIN: The closer I get to you, the worse it gets. Th-the thought of not being with you makes my stomach turn over Ð my mouth goes dry. I feel dizzy. I can\\'t breathe. I\\'m haunted by the kiss that you should never have given me. My heart is beating, hoping that that kiss will not become a scar. You are in my very soul, tormenting me. What can I do? I will do anything you ask...\\n\\nSilence. The logs flame in the hearth.

If you follow your thoughts through to conclusion, itÕll take us to a place we cannot go... regardless of the way we feel about each other.\\nANAKIN: Then you do feel something! There\\'s an extraordinary connection between us. You can\\'t deny that.\\nPADME: Ani, it doesn\\'t make any difference. Jedi aren\\'t allowed to love. You swore an oath, remember? You\\'d be expelled from the Order. I will not let you give up your responsibilities, your future, for me.\\nANAKIN: (gets up) I was destined to be a Jedi. I don\\'t think I could be anything else. But youÕre asking me to be rational. That is something I know I cannot do. Believe me, I wish that I could just wish away my feelings... but I can\\'t.\\nPADME: I will not give into this!!

JEDI TEMPLE, YODAÕS QUARTERS Ð LATE AFTERNOON\\n\\nYoda and Mace Windu listen as a hologram of Obi-Wan (out in the rain by his starfighter) stands between them broadcasting the massage. The signal is very weak, the image fades in and out.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: (V.O.) I have successfully made contact with the Prime Minister of Kamino. They are using a bounty hunter named Jango Fett to create a clone army. I have a strong feeling that this bounty hunter is the assassin weÕre looking for.\\nMACE WINDU: Do you think these cloners are involved in the plot to assassinate Senator Amidala? \\nOBI-WAN: (V.O.) No, Master. There appears to be no motive.\\nYODA: Do not assume anything, Obi-Wan. Clear your mind must be if you are to discover the real villains behind this plot. \\nOBI-WAN: (V.O.) Yes, Master. They say Master Sifo-Dyas placed an order for the clone army at the request of the Senate almost ten years ago. \\n\\nYoda and Mace Windu glance at each other in surprise. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: I was under the impression he was killed before that. Did the Council ever authorize the creation of a clone army?\\nMACE WINDU: No. Whoever placed that order did not have the authorization of the Jedi Council, I can assure you.\\nYODA: Into custody take this Jango Fett. Bring him here -- question him, we will. \\nOBI-WAN: (V.O.) Yes, Master. I will report back when I have him. May the Force... \\n\\nThe hologram switches off, and Obi-Wan fades away. \\n\\nMACE WINDU: A clone army?!? Why would Sifo-DyasÉ\\nYODA: When placed this order was may provide insight. \\nMACE WINDU: If this Jango Fett was involved in trying to kill the SenatorÉand just happened to be chosen as the source for a clone army created for the RepublicÉ\\n\\nHe shakes his head, completely baffled. \\n\\nYODA: Blind we are, if the creation of this clone army we could not see. \\n\\nMace sighs heavily and lowers his head. \\n\\nMACE WINDU: (quietly) I think it is time we informed the Senate that our ability to use the Force has diminished. \\nYODA: Only the Dark Lord of the Sith knows of our weakness.

I know I will be punished, and possibly thrown out of the Jedi Order. But I have to go. I have to help her. \\nPADME: (gently) AniÉI told you I wouldnÕt let you give up your future for me. IÕll go with you. That way you can continue to protect me, and you wonÕt be disobeying your mandate. \\nANAKIN: I donÕt think this is what the Jedi Council had in mind.

TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR OUTSIDE FETT APARTMENT -- DAY\\n\\nObi-Wan arrives at the door to Jango FettÕs apartment. He reaches up and runs his fingers along the door, locating the locks. The door slides open. \\n\\nINT. TIPOCA CITY, FETT APARTMENT -- DAY\\n\\nObi-Wan walks in to find the room is in complete disorder. The bedroom door is wide-open Ð clear signs of hurried departure. All of the FettsÕ personal belongings are gone. Obi-Wan goes to an ultra-thin computer screen. He punches up an onscreen picture of Jango Fett and Boba Fett unhitching the lines securing their ship on the landing platform. Jango Fett is wearing his blue-and-silver armor and rocket pack. \\n\\nEXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) Ð DAY\\n\\nJango FettÕs ship, Slave I, rests on the landing platform. Jango and Boba Fett are preparing to board. \\n\\nJANGO FETT: Yeah, IÕll let you fly it. \\n\\nBoba punches a fist into the air in triumph. \\n\\nJANGO FETT: Not to take her out though. WeÕre going out hot, son, but weÕll take her back out of lightspeed early so you can get some time working her about. \\n\\nBoba nods, hoists another bag and starts up the shipÕs ramp. His eyes suddenly go wide. \\n\\nBOBA FETT: Dad, look!\\n\\nJango turns from his son to see Obi-Wan charging out of the tower at him, drawing and igniting his lightsaber as he does. \\n \\nJANGO FETT: BOBA, GET ONBOARD!!\\n\\nJango then opens fire with one blaster as Boba scrambles up the ramp. Obi-Wan deflects the bolts. As Jango continues firing, he moves behind and around pillars. Obi-Wan shuffles while deflecting the bolts. \\n\\nAs Jango moves behind a pillar, Obi-Wan charges forward. Jango then unholsters a second blaster and begins firing with both weapons. Obi-Wan has trouble deflecting the barrage of bolts. \\n\\nJango takes off (using his jetpack) over the top of Obi-Wan. Obi-Wan swings his lightsaber in attempt to take Jango down, but misses. As he is flying past, Jango pivots in the air and fires down at Obi-Wan from a high angle. Obi-Wan deflects the bolts from above. Jango continues to fire with both blasters as he flies away from Obi-Wan. Under the barrage of two blasters, Obi-Wan struggles to deflect every bolt. He then rolls off to the side to avoid the bolts as Jango flies off behind a tower. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: YouÕre coming with me, Jango!\\n\\nEmerging on the top of the tower, Jango fires a rocket that is protruding from the top of his jetpack. Obi-Wan avoids the explosion, but is sent sprawling by the report and he accidentally drops his lightsaber. The weapon skids across the wet surface of the landing platform. Jango flies higher and out of the picture. \\n\\nINT. COCKPIT, FETT SHIP, TIPOCA CITY, LANDING PLATFORM\\n\\nBoba scrambles into the cockpit and scans the console panel.

ItÕll go easier on you and your son if -- \\n\\nObi-Wan senses something and turns just in time to see Slave I opening fire on him with itsÕ heavy blasters. The shots miss, but Obi-Wan is again knocked to the ground hard.\\n\\nJango appears from above and jumps down. Obi-Wan recovers, and with a yell, leaps forward to jump-kick Jango in the face. Jango crashes back onto the landing platform. Obi-Wan lands on his feet. \\n\\nJango quickly recovers and charges forward. \\n\\nINT. COCKPIT, FETT SHIP, TIPOCA CITY, LANDING PLATFORM\\n\\nBoba Fett watches in horror as the two men crash into each other.\\n\\nEXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) Ð DAY\\n\\nIn close quarters, Obi-Wan blocks Jango\\'s attempt to raise his blaster to fire as the pair struggle for the weapon. Obi-Wan then elbows Jango hard in the face. HIGH ANGLE shot as Obi-Wan then judo flips Jango over his back. Jango hits the ground hard but recovers quickly as Obi-Wan moves in for an attack. \\n\\nJango grabs and traps Obi-WanÕs foot. Jango spins Obi-Wan (in mid air) and brings him down face-first onto the ground. Obi-Wan retaliates from the ground with a sweep kick to Jango\\'s head, knocking him back. \\n\\nObi-Wan gets to his feet. Jango also gets up and takes aim with his arm-mounted blaster. Obi-Wan leaps over the bolts and onto Jango\\'s shoulders, then flips himself back and over, flipping Jango over and onto his back. But Jango then rolls to his feet. \\n\\nObi-Wan charges with a punch. Jango moves in to attack, chopping at Obi-Wan\\'s head. Obi-Wan blocks it. Jango ducks a wild punch and grabs Obi-Wan by his waist. He then savagely headbutts Obi-Wan to the ground. He lands and skids over the wet surface. Obi-Wan then comes to a halt on the ground and spots somethingÉ his lightsaber. \\n\\nJango suddenly appears, flying towards Obi-Wan. Obi-Wan gets up and reaches for his lightsaber (to summon it with the Force). Jango fires a cable from his wrist that wraps around Obi-Wan\\'s hands as he fails to catch his lightsaber. \\n\\nJango takes off into the air (with jetpack again), still tied to Obi-Wan. Obi-Wan is dragged along the ground. LOW ANGLE behind Obi-Wan as he is being dragged. HIGH ANGLE on Jango, who is still flying. \\n\\nObi-Wan then rolls to one side while being dragged. He manages to roll around, to the other side of one of the oncoming pillars. Obi-Wan then jumps up and wraps the cable around the pillar, pulling with all his weight against the momentum of the wire. Jango crashes to the ground. The jetpack shoots off on its own and into the side of a building, exploding. \\n\\nINT.

TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) Ð DAY\\n\\nJango scrambles across the wet floor to grab his fallen blaster. Obi-Wan (with his hands still tied) charges. Jango gets to his feet and fires, but misses. Obi-Wan kicks Jango over the side of the platform. Jango begins to slide down the angled side of the platform. Obi-WanÕs eyes go wide as he realizes what heÕs done. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: Oh, not good --\\n\\nObi-Wan, who is still connected to Jango by the cable, gets pulled to the edge of the platform. \\n\\nAlmost over the complete edge, Jango activates the claws on the side of his forearm. Jango then digs his \"claws\" into the platform. Obi-Wan continues down, past Jango and falls over the edge. \\n\\nStill tied to Jango, Obi-Wan hangs, nothing between him and the raging sea. Obi-Wan then begins to swing back and forth. Jango is gradually getting pulled more and more down, so he releases the cable. DISTANT SHOT as Obi-Wan free-falls. \\n\\nObi-Wan uses the Force and causes the wire to wrap around a pole, stopping his descent. When Jango looks down, the Jedi has disappeared. Jango uses his forearm claws to climb back to the landing platform and runs toward his ship. Obi-Wan swings and drops onto a small service platform just over the waves. Waving a door open with the Force, he disappears back into the city. \\n\\nINT. COCKPIT, FETT SHIP, TIPOCA CITY, LANDING PLATFORM\\n\\nBoba Fett settles into the pilotÕs seat and punches buttons. The engines ROAR. \\n\\nEXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) Ð DAY\\n\\nObi-Wan comes running out onto the landing platform and spots his lightsaber laying on the ground. This time, he retrieves it successfully with the Force and turns it on just as JangoÕs ship engines roar. Realizing the ship is about to take off, Obi-Wan takes a small tracking device from his belt and throws it. The tracking device sticks to the hull of the ship. Obi-Wan watches from the platform as Slave I takes off into the rain. It disappears into the lowering sky, as lightning flashes. Rain lashes the tower and streams the surface of the platform where Obi-Wan stands, watching. \\n\\nEXT. SPACE Ð NEAR KAMINO\\n\\nSlave I screams into hyperspace. \\n\\nINT.

Better than I ever believed possible. \\nBOBA FETT: ThatÕs because IÕm a little you. \\n\\nJango shakes his head. \\n\\nJANGO FETT: YouÕre better than I was at your age, and by a long way. If you keep working hard, youÕll be the best bounty hunter this galaxyÕs ever seen. \\nBOBA FETT: Which was your plan from the beginning, right? ThatÕs why you wanted me? \\nJANGO FETT: (wistful) That, and a few other reasons. \\n\\nHe tousles the boyÕs hair lovingly. \\n\\nJANGO FETT: And in every regardÉin every hope and dreamÉyouÕve done better than I expected. \\n\\nBoba hugs his dad tightly.

Threepio shuffles ahead.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Master Owen, might I present two most important visitors? \\n\\nOWEN LARS and BERU WHITESUN come out into the courtyard. Both in their early twenties, plain-looking. \\n\\nANAKIN: I\\'m Anakin Skywalker. I\\'m here looking for my mother.\\n\\nOwenÕs eyes go wide. \\n\\nOWEN: AnakinÉ!!\\nBERU: Anakin the JediÉ\\nANAKIN: You know me? Shmi Skywalker is my motherÉ\\nOWEN: Mine too. Not my real mom, butÉas real a mom as IÕve ever known. Owen Lars.\\n\\nThe two shake hands. \\n\\nOWEN: This is my girlfriend, Beru Whitesun.\\nBERU: Hello.\\nPADME: I\\'m Padme.\\nOWEN: I guess IÕm your stepbrother. I had a feeling you might show up some day.\\nANAKIN: Is my mother here?\\nCLIEGG: No, she\\'s not.\\n\\nCLIEGG LARS swings from the house on a small floating chair. One of his legs is heavily bandaged; the other is missing. He balances awkwardly and puts out a hand.\\n\\nCLIEGG: Cliegg Lars. Shmi is my wife... \\n\\nAnakin takes the offered hand. \\n\\nCLIEGG: We should go inside. We have a lot to talk about.\\n\\nINT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, KITCHEN - LATE DAY\\n\\nBeru puts several steaming cups of ardees on a tray and exits the kitchen.\\n\\nCLIEGG: (O.S.) It was just before dawn. They came out of nowhere. A hunting party of Tusken Raiders.\\n\\nINT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, DINING AREA - LATE DAY\\n\\nCliegg, Owen, Padme and Anakin sit around the table, Beru brings the drinks from the kitchen.\\n\\nCLIEGG: Your mother had gone out early, like she always did, to pick mushrooms that grow on the vaporators. From the tracks, she was about halfway home when they took her. (sigh) Those Tuskens walk like menÉ but they\\'re vicious, mindless monsters. \\nOWEN: (bitter) WeÕd seen signs they were about. She shouldnÕt have gone out!\\nCLIEGG: We canÕt live huddled in fear. (to Anakin) All signs were that weÕd chased the Tuskens away. We didnÕt know how strong this raiding party was Ð stronger than anything any of us have ever seen. Thirty of us went out after her. Four of us came back. Three more are still out there looking. I\\'d be out there with them, only... after I lost my leg, I just couldn\\'t ride any more... until I heal.\\n\\nCliegg grimaces, easing his throbbing leg. But itÕs clear his torment isnÕt just physical. He finally draws in a deep breath and squares his shoulders. \\n\\nCLIEGG: This isn\\'t the way I wanted to meet you, son. This isn\\'t how your mother and I planned it. I don\\'t want to give up on her, but she\\'s been gone a month. There\\'s little hope she\\'s lasted this long.\\n\\nThe words hit Anakin like a slap to the face, and he bolts to his feet.\\n\\nOWEN: Where are you going?\\nANAKIN: (cold and accusing) To find my mother.\\nPADME: No, Ani!\\nCLIEGG: Your motherÕs dead, son. Accept it.\\n\\nAnakin stares daggers at them all, gritting his teeth. \\n\\nANAKIN: I can feel her pain, and I will find her. \\nOWEN: Take my speeder bike.\\nANAKIN: I know she\\'s alive.\\n\\nAnakin turns abruptly and runs up the side of the homestead. Padme winces helplessly, and watches him go.\\n\\nOWEN: I wish heÕd have come a bit earlierÉ\\n\\nEXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, MOISTURE FARM - LATE DAY\\n\\nAnakin stands looking across the desert. Padme comes running out of the homestead after him. Anakin turns to Padme.\\n\\nANAKIN: You are going to have to stay here. These are good people, Padme. You\\'ll be safe.\\nPADME: Anakin...\\n\\nPadme hugs him tightly. \\n\\nANAKIN: I know sheÕs alive. \\nPADME: Find her. \\n\\nAnakin walks over to Owen\\'s speeder bike, which is standing close by. \\n\\nANAKIN: I won\\'t be long.\\n\\nAnakin swings onto the bike. The engine fires. He takes off across the desert. \\n\\nEXT. TATOOINE, LANDSCAPE Ð SUNSET\\n\\nTHREE DIFFERENT SHOTS. Anakin rides the speeder bike through three exotic landscapes. The haunting choral wail and trumpets of ÒDuel of the FatesÓ blasts over the scene. \\n\\nEXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, JAWA CAMP -- TWILIGHT\\n\\nAnakin stands in the middle of a crowd of Jawas asking them for directions. The Jawas confer excitedly, then the Chief Jawa points in a particular direction. Anakin gets on his swoop and speeds off to where the Jawa pointed.\\n\\nEXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, HOMESTEAD (FULL MOON) -- NIGHT\\n\\nAnakin rides over a large dune, lit by the full moon overhead. He heads toward a small flickering light in the distance. He pulls up and stops the bike in front of a campfire. There are bodies of three dead farmers lying beside the campfire, all battered and torn. Two eopies are tethered nearby, along with a burned and smoking speeder. \\n\\nANAKIN: Calm downÉfind herÉ\\n\\nHe closes his eyes and concentratesÉthen almost screams in agony.\\n\\nANAKIN: momÉ\\n\\nHe leaps back onto the speeder bike, racing away faster and more desperate than ever. \\n\\nEXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, COURTYARD (FULL MOON) -- NIGHT\\n\\nBack at the homestead, the lights of the vaporators blink in the night sky. Somewhere close by, a night animal howls. \\n\\nEXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, COURTYARD (FULL MOON) -- NIGHT\\n\\nPadme is pacing the courtyard restlessly. She stops, listening to the animal howling nearby. She shivers slightly, then turns and goes into the garage at the side of the courtyard.\\n\\nINT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, GARAGE (FULL MOON) Ð NIGHT\\n\\nPadme enters the garage where Threepio sits working. \\n\\nTHREEPIO: Hello, Miss Padme. \\nPADME: Hello, Threepio. \\nTHREEPIO: You canÕt sleep? \\nPADME: No. I have too many things on my mind, I guess. \\nTHREEPIO: Are you worried about your work in the Senate? \\nPADME: No. IÕm just concerned about Anakin. I said thingsÉIÕm afraid I may have hurt him. I donÕt know. Maybe I only hurt myself. For the first time in my life, IÕm confused. \\nTHREEPIO: IÕm not sure it will make you feel any better, Miss Padme, but I donÕt think thereÕs been a time in my life when I havenÕt been confused. \\nPADME: I want him to know I care about him. (self-realization) I do care about him... \\nTHREEPIO: DonÕt worry about Master Ani. He can take care of himself. Even in this awful place. \\n\\nEXT. GEONOSIS, ROCK FACE TRAIL - NIGHT\\n\\nObi-Wan climbs a steep, narrow trail. Suddenly, a cry is heard close by. Obi-Wan stumbles slightly. His foot slips on the edge, sending a stream of pebbles skittering into the distance. \\n\\nObi-Wan listens. Silence. He draws his lightsaber but does not ignite it. \\n\\nHe sets off again and works his way around a narrow corner, to confront a crouching MASSIFF (a dog-sized lizard) with slavering fangs! The beast leaps at him, and Obi-Wan ignites his lightsaber as the MASSIFF knocks him on his back. Its jaws open wide. Obi-Wan stabs the creature, throws it off of him, and jumps up. \\n\\nA second Massiff jumps him from behind. Obi-Wan swings around and cuts it in half. The Massiff flies over the cliff. Howling, it plummets to its death hundreds of feet below. \\n\\nEXT. GEONOSIS, ANOTHER ROCK FACE TRAIL -- NIGHT\\n\\nObi-Wan arrives at the head of the trail. Far below, a flat plain stretches into the distance. He stops, peering into the darkness, where strange shapes loom indistinctly.\\n\\nObi-Wan takes a pair of electronic binoculars from his belt and puts them to his eyes. He sees a cluster of great towers like fantastic stalagmites rise from the plain below.\\n\\nSLOW PAN with the binoculars, and suddenly a line of Core Starships come into view. Obi-Wan touches the viewfinder. Between fifty and a hundred Federation Core Starships are in neat rows. Some are on platforms that are carrying the Starships down to an underground facility. Other platforms are rising to the surface. They carry THOUSANDS of BATTLE DROIDS that step off and file into the waiting ships. A fully loaded Starship takes off. Obi-Wan swings the binoculars upward, to see more Federation Starships.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: UnbelievableÉ \\n \\nEXT. GEONOSIS Ð TOWER ENTRANCE -- DAWN\\n\\nLight grows on the clustering tower of fantastic stalagmites. Obi-Wan sneaks up to the main one. He climbs up the side of the tower to a small window-like opening. Obi-Wan looks around quickly, then sneaks inside. \\n\\nINT. GEONOSIS, CORRIDORS -- MORNING\\n\\nObi-Wan makes his way along a narrow, pillared corridor. He comes to what looks like a large open well or vent shaft. He looks down and seesÉA MONSTROUS DROID FOUNDRY. \\n\\nThere are machines everywhere, pounding out countless battle droids identical to the ones that attacked Naboo a decade before. Completed battle droids are moving along a conveyor belt. Geonosians (without wings, a worker class) drone away on the assembly lines to assemble the droids. \\n\\nINT. GEONOSIS, CENTRAL SQUARE -- MORNING\\n\\nObi-Wan arrives at a vast expanse in the stalagmite interior. Immense pillars, soaring Gaudi-Gothic arches, vaulted roofs. The huge space is deserted Ð completely silent. Obi-Wan starts to cross the square. Suddenly he hears voices, and darts behind a pillar. \\n\\nWe see COUNT DOOKU for the first time. A man in his late seventies, with short white hair and a silver beard, Dooku is very fit and trim for his age and is dressed in elegant clothes. Alongside him is VICEROY NUTE GUNRAY of the Trade Federation, POGGLE THE LESSER (Archduke of Geonosis), PASSEL ARGENTE and WAT TAMBOR. Obi-Wan flattens himself against the pillar as they pass by.\\n \\nCOUNT DOOKU: Now we must convince the Commerce Guild and the Corporate Alliance to sign the treaty. Then nothing in the universe will be able to stop us. \\nNUTE GUNRAY: What about the Senator from Naboo? Is she dead yet?? IÕm not signing your treaty until I have her head on my desk!! \\nCOUNT DOOKU: I am a man of my word, Viceroy. \\nWAT TAMBOR: The foundry is running at maximum capacity. In less than a few months, with these new battle droids weÕve built for you, Viceroy, youÕll have the finest army in the galaxy. \\nNUTE GUNRAY: Your early tests on the Super Battle Droid prototypes have gone well. But they are a little less precise than I expectedÉ\\nWAT TAMBOR: Their advanced features will make up for that.\\n\\nThey move off out of earshot. Obi-Wan peers around the pillar to see them going through an archway on the far side of the courtyard. There is a flight of stairs beside it. Obi-Wan arrives at the stairs. He sneaks up them, to arrive at a narrow gothic archway. He looks down through it. \\n\\nINT. GEONOSIS, CONFERENCE ROOM Ð DAY\\n\\nPoggle the Lesser and his TWO AIDES are at one end of a large conference table. \\n\\nCOUNT DOOKU: Now is the time, my friends. This is the moment when you have to decide between the RepublicÉor the Confederacy of Independent Systems. \\n\\nCount Dooku is at the head of the table. Jango Fett stands behind his chair. \\n\\nIn addition to the original group, there are also three opposition senators: PO NUDO, TESSEK and TOONBUCK TOORA, and Commerce Guild dignitary SHU MAI and SAN HILL of the Intergalactic Bank Clan. \\n\\nCOUNT DOOKU: As I explained to you earlier, I am quite convinced that ten thousand more star systems will rally to our cause with your support, gentlemen. And let me remind you of our absolute commitment to capitalismÉof the lower taxes, the reduced tariffs, and the eventual abolition of all trade barriers. Signing this treaty will bring you all profits beyond your wildest imagination. What we are promising is completely free trade. \\n\\nPASSEL ARGENTE, the Corporate Alliance Representative, stands up.\\n\\nPASSEL ARGENTE: I am authorized by the Corporate Alliance to sign your treaty. \\nCOUNT DOOKU: We are most grateful for your cooperation, Chairman. \\n\\nShu Mai stands up next. \\n\\nSHU MAI: (subtitled) The Commerce Guilds do not wish Ð at this time Ð to become openly involved. What you are proposing could be construed as treason. But we shall support the cause in secret, and look forward to doing business with you. \\n\\nEveryone chuckles at that. Count Dooku smiles.\\n\\nCOUNT DOOKU: That is all we ask. \\n\\nWat Tambor, the metallic Techno Union representative, twists a knob on his chest and speaks next. \\n\\nWAT TAMBOR: The Techno Union army (electronic gibberish) is at your disposal, Count. \\n\\nSan Hill stands up. \\n\\nSAN HILL: The Banking Clan will sign your treaty, and support you wholeheartedly. But only in a non-exclusive arrangementÉ\\nCOUNT DOOKU: Good, very good. (nods to Nute) Our friends in the Trade Federation have pledged their full support. And when their battle droids are combined with yours, we shall have an army greater than any in the galaxy. The Jedi will be overwhelmed. The Republic will agree to any demands we make. \\n\\nINT. GEONOSIS, STAIRS -- DAY\\n\\nObi-Wan has heard enough. He pulls back from the archway. \\n \\nEXT. TATOOINE, CLIFF (FULL MOON) -- NIGHT\\n\\nAnakin pulls up near the edge of a cliff. He gets off the bike and creeps to the edge. He looks over to see a Tusken camp in the oasis below. One of the dried-mud huts at the edge of the camp has two Tusken guards outside it. Anakin drops off the edge of the cliff to the camp below. \\n\\nEXT. TATOOINE, TUSKEN RAIDER CAMP, OASIS (FULL MOON) -- NIGHT\\n\\nAnakin creeps through the camp, working his way from hut to hut, flattening himself against the walls, overhearing snatches of Tusken conversation from inside, using the shadows to hide himself until he arrives at the hut with two guards. They are sitting a short distance from the door. Anakin wriggles around the back. He takes out his lightsaber and cuts into the base of the wall. \\n\\nINT. TUSKEN RAIDER HUT -- NIGHT\\n\\nThe lightsaber completes the hole in the wall. Anakin wriggles in. He pulls himself to his feet. There are candles everywhere. \\n\\nA shaft of moonlight from a hole in the roof pierces the gloom of the hut. By its light, Anakin sees SHMI, hanging crucified from a cross-like wooden frame in the middle of the hut. \\n\\nHe cuts her free, takes her into his arms, and lowers her gently to the ground. Her eyes are closed. Her face and body are covered in blood. She has been savagely beaten, starved and whipped. Anakin cradles her tenderly. \\n\\nANAKIN: (eyes tearing up) MomÉ momÉ??\\nSHMI: aÉaniÉ? \\n\\nShmiÕs eyes flutter and barely open, caked with dried blood. \\n\\nSHMI: Is it youÉ? \\n\\nHer eyes focus slowly. Anakin gives a little choking gasp.\\n\\nANAKIN: (voice shaking) IÕm here, Mom. YouÕre safe. Hang on, IÕm going to get you out of hereÉ\\nSHMI: aniÉ.aniÉ. \\n\\nShe smiles, seemingly all rightÉbut her face, what little of it isnÕt bloodied, is gray. Anakin shivers in fear. \\n\\nSHMI: You look so handsomeÉ. \\n\\nHe kisses her hand as she caresses his cheek. \\n\\nSHMI: (growing weaker by the second) my sonÉ my grown up sonÉ.iÕm so proud of you, aniÉ so proudÉ \\nANAKIN: I missed you so muchÉ \\nSHMI: now i am completeÉiÉ.l-loveÉ\\n\\nSheÕs struggling for air. AnakinÕs about to panic. \\n\\nANAKIN: Stay with me, Mom!! IÕm going to make you well again. EverythingÕsÉ going to be fineÉ.\\nSHMI: iÉi loveÉ\\n\\nHer breath stops in mid-sentence, and her eyes unfocus. She lolls against AnakinÕs side, lifeless. Anakin is completely shattered, eyes pouring with tears. He looks down at her, and gently closes her eyes. There is silence for a moment. \\n\\nAnakin slowly looks upÉand his expression is one of pure rage.  \\n\\nEXT. TATOOINE, TUSKEN RAIDER CAMP, OASIS Ð DAWN\\n\\nThe pale light grows. Thin tendrils of smoke rise slowly in the cold, clear air. Somewhere a dog barks. An OLD WOMAN comes out of one of the huts. She carries a pail. She swirls it and tosses the dirty water onto the ground. As she goes back inside the hut, a TUSKEN CHILD runs past, dragging a stick in the sand. The child runs through the line of huts, turns a corner, and stops suddenly, staring at the two Tusken guards. \\n\\nBetween them, Anakin stands outside the hut door. His face is a grim mask. The child stares, then there is a flash of light as AnakinÕs lightsaber switches on. \\n\\nBefore the guards can even turn, Anakin ignites his lightsaber and decapitates them both in one swing. The old Tusken woman sees this and runs screaming for help. Another Tusken Raider rushes at Anakin. With his teeth gritted, and wielding his lightsaber like a baseball bat, the Jedi apprentice chops the TuskenÕs head from his body and sends it flying several feet. Anakin slowly, deliberately walks toward the little Tusken child, lightsaber raised, the same evil look on his face. He swings the sword down at the little girl Ð \\n\\nEXT. CORUSCANT, YODA\\'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \\n\\nYoda sits down Indian-style in a dimly lit, small, circular chamber. His eyes are closed as he attempts a meditative state. He sees nothing. But he hears something. \\n\\nIt is a familiar voice, the surprisingly familiar voice of Qui-Gon Jinn. It is heard as though from a great distance, and it is filled with alarm.\\n\\nQUI-GON: (V.O.) Anakin!! ANAKIN!! NNNNOOOOOO!!!!!!!! \\n\\nMace Windu enters the room and sits down. Yoda opens his eyes slowly and stares sadly at Mace. \\n\\nMACE WINDU: What is it? \\nYODA: PainÉsufferingÉdeath, I feelÉsomething terrible has happened. Young Skywalker is in pain. Terrible painÉ\\n\\nEXT. TATOOINE, TUSKEN RAIDER CAMP, OASIS Ð DAWN\\n\\nWith a feral snarl, Anakin buries his lightsaber up to the hilt in the old womanÕs chest. With a weak scream, the woman crashes to the ground. Tuskens are now streaming out of every hut. Anakin leaps high into the air, bringing his weapon slashing down upon two of the Tuskens. With each death, his frenzy and bloodlust grows. \\n\\nAnother Tusken rushes at him, wielding a spear. Anakin thrusts out a hand, and the Tusken is hurtled back through the Force thirty meters, smashing through a hut wall. Anakin continues swinging and slashing at the Tuskens. Arms, legs, heads, pieces of torso, all fall on the sandy ground. Blood is flying everywhere. Panic grips the surviving Tuskens, and they turn to flee. Several run into one of the huts. Anakin motions to a large boulder in the distance. The giant rock flies into the air, arcing, and smashes the hut flat. He begins running with unearthly speed after the remaining, fleeing Tuskens. A sickening, evil grin splits his face as he runs. \\n\\nEXT. GEONOSIS, LANDING AREA Ð DAY\\n\\nObi-Wan examines the transmitter dish on the StarfighterÕs hull, and speaks with Arfour.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: The transmitter is working. But weÕre not receiving a return signal Ð CoruscantÕs too far. Arfour, can you boost the power? \\n\\nArfour beeps doubtfully. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: Okay then, weÕll have to try something else. \\n\\nObi-Wan jumps into the cockpit. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: Maybe we can contact Anakin on Naboo. ItÕs much closer. (works some controls) Anakin? Anakin, do you copy? This is Obi-Wan Kenobi. Anakin? (beat) HeÕs not on Naboo, Arfour. \\n\\nArfour moans. Obi-Wan works on the console. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: IÕm going to try and widen the range. I do hope nothingÕs happened to him. \\n\\nThe console beeps after a moment. Far off in the distance, a Geonosian spies Obi-Wan and his Starfighter from an overlooking cliff.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: ThatÕs AnakinÕs tracking signal all right, but itÕs coming fromÉ Tatooine. \\n\\nObi-Wan hops back out of the starfighter. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: What in the blazes is he doing there?!? I told him to stay on Naboo!\\n\\nArfour moans again.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: All right, weÕre all set Ð weÕll get these answers later. We havenÕt got much time. Transmit. (beat) Anakin? Anakin, do you copy?

TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, DINING AREA - MORNING\\n\\nPadme keeps a lonely vigil with Owen, Beru, Threepio and Cliegg. Owen looks over at Threepio, then over at Padme. \\n\\nOWEN: PadmeÉIÕm returning this droid to Anakin. I know thatÕs what my mom would want. \\n\\nPadme nods. A growing noise from outside, the whine of the speeder bike, brings the whole group rushing outdoors. \\n\\nEXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, HOMESTEAD MOISTURE FARM Ð MORNING\\n\\nPadme and the Lars family rush outside Ð and stop, shocked. \\n\\nAnakin climbs down from the speeder bike, unties his motherÕs dead body from the bike, then trudges toward them bearing the body in his arms. With glassy eyes, he walks up to a trembling Cliegg and stares at him silently. ItÕs all Beru can do to keep from openly sobbing. Owen drapes his arm around BeruÕs shoulders, a tear streaking down his cheek. Padme moves over to Anakin to try to console him with a hug. He pushes her away. He wonÕt look at her. He wonÕt look at any of them. \\n\\nANAKIN: If I hadn\\'t gone away, none of this would have happened. We\\'d be happy.\\nCLIEGG: You\\'d still be slaves.\\nANAKIN: But at least she\\'d still be alive.\\n\\nHe slowly carries his motherÕs body into the homestead. \\n\\nINT.

TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, GARAGE Ð DAY\\n\\nAnakin stands at a workbench, working slowly on a part off the speeder bike. Padme quietly comes in with a tray of food.

You were the most loving partner a man could ever have. Goodbye, my darling wifeÉand thank you. \\n\\nA pause. Then Anakin kneels before the black gravestone. He picks up a handful of sand and lets it slip through his fingers.  \\n\\nANAKIN: IÕm sorry. \\n\\nHe almost breaks down again, but takes a deep breath and continues. \\n\\nANAKIN: I wasnÕt strong enough to save you, Mom.

COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP Ð DAY\\n\\nAnakin and Padme bolt upright as the image of Obi-Wan is moved out of view and replaced by the firing droidekas. The image suddenly cuts out. \\n\\nANAKIN: MASTER!! IÕm going after him!\\n\\nINT. CORUSCANT, CHANCELLORÕS OFFICE -- NIGHT\\n\\nThe Senators are immobilized with wide-eyed horror. Palpatine stares at the blank holoprojector in ashen disbelief. Yoda looks over to Mace Windu. \\n\\nYODA: He is still alive. I feel him in the Force. \\nMACE WINDU: But they have taken him. And the wheels have begun to spin more dangerously.\\nYODA: More happening on Geonosis, I feel, than has been revealed. \\nMACE WINDU: I agree. We must not sit idly by.\\n\\nYoda closes his eyes, pained by it all. \\n\\nYODA: The Dark Side I feelÉall is cloudyÉ\\n  \\nMace nods and looks at the now-empty hologram.\\n\\nMACE WINDU: Anakin -- \\n\\nINT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP -- DAY\\n\\nA holoimage of Mace Windu appears where Obi-WanÕs was. \\n\\nMACE WINDU: (V.O.) We will deal with Count Dooku. The most important thing for you is to stay where you are. Protect the Senator at all costs. That is your first priority.\\nANAKIN: Understood, Master. \\n\\nThe hologram fades away. Padme is horrified at the look of utter resignation and defeat on AnakinÕs face. She looks at the readout on the ship\\'s control panel.\\n\\nPADME: They\\'ll never get there in time to save him. They have to come halfway across the galaxy. LookÉ \\n\\nPadme starts to hit buttons and flick switches. A star map comes up on the console. \\n\\nPADME: Geonosis is less than a parsec away.\\nANAKIN: If he\\'s still alive.\\n\\nHe gets up and starts to walk off. Padme is incensed.\\n\\nPADME: Ani, are you just going to sit here and let him die?!? He\\'s your friend, your mentor --\\nANAKIN: He\\'s like my father!! (on her look) Well, you heard Master Windu -- he gave me strict orders to stay here!!\\nPADME: He gave you strict orders to protect me...and I\\'m going to help Obi-Wan.\\n\\nShe pulls her hand free and flicks more switches. The engines warm up. \\n\\nPADME: So if you plan to protect me, you will just have to come along.\\n\\nAnakin stares at herÉand slowly grins. He sits down and takes the controls. Threepio comes forward from the back of the starship and straps himself into a seat behind Padme. Artoo whistles at him. \\n\\nTHREEPIO: IÕm not worried, Artoo. ItÕs justÉIÕve never flown beforeÉ\\n \\nEXT. TATOOINE, BLUFF OVERLOOKING HOMESTEAD Ð DAY\\n\\nThe Naboo Starship rises from the bluff and zooms away.  \\n \\nINT. CORUSCANT, CHANCELLORÕS OFFICE -- DAY\\n\\nBail Organa paces around. The others are all silent. \\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: The Commerce Guilds are preparing for war. There can be no doubt of that. \\nASK AAK: If the report is accurate. \\nMACE WINDU: It is, Senator. \\nPALPATINE: Count Dooku must have made a treaty with themÉ\\nBAIL ORGANA: We must stop them. Now, before theyÕre fully ready. \\nJAR JAR: Exsqueeze me, yousa honorable Supreme Chancellor, sir. Maybe dissen Jedi stoppinÕ da rebel army? \\nPALPATINE: Master Yoda, how many are available to go to Geonosis? \\n\\nYoda and Mace look at each other with a mutual sinking feeling. \\n\\nYODA: Throughout the galaxy, thousands of Jedi there are. To send on a special missionÉonly two hundred are available.\\n\\nEveryone in the room is stunned. \\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: Two hundred?!? With all due respect for the Jedi Order, that doesnÕt sound like enough!! \\nYODA: Through negotiation the Jedi maintain peace. To start a war, we do not intend. \\nASK AAK: (to Palpatine) The debate is over!! Now we need that clone army.\\nBAIL ORGANA: Unfortunately, the debate is not over. The Senate will never approve the use of clones before the separatists attack. By then, it would be too late. \\nMAS AMEDDA: (panic) This is a crisis!! The Senate must vote the Chancellor emergency powers!! He can then approve the creation of an army!!\\nPALPATINE: Please, please. I donÕt wish to have emergency powers Ð itÕs too extreme a solution. ItÕs akin to a dictatorship. We must rely on the Jedi.\\nASK AAK: We must prepare for the worst. IÕm going to propose a motion granting emergency powers to the Chancellor at the next session. We must not wait! \\nPALPATINE: Out of the question, Senator!! You and I are too closely aligned. The issue will quickly become partisan, then debates will beginÉno. \\nBAIL ORGANA: We have spent too much of our political capital. The Senate will not see our call as anything more than overly alarmist. \\nPALPATINE: But what Senator would have the courage to propose such a radical amendment? \\nBAIL ORGANA: We need a voice of reason. One willing to reverse position even, given the gravity of the current situation. \\nMAS AMEDDA: (despair) If onlyÉ Senator Amidala were hereÉ\\nPALPATINE: Hmm. \\n\\nA beat. Then Jar Jar suddenly steps into the center of the room. \\n\\nJAR JAR: Mesa mosto Supreme Chancellor, mesa gusto palosÉmesa proud to proposing da motion to give Yousa Honor emergency powers. \\nASK AAK: (overjoyed) Thank you, Representative Binks!\\n\\nA moment. Then Palpatine sighs deeply. \\n\\nPALPATINE: If called upon, I will serve. But it will be the saddest day of my life.  \\n\\nINT. GEONOSIS, PRISON CELL -- DAY\\n\\nObi-Wan is being suspended in mid-air by a blue electric beam in the center of a vast circular chamber. Count Dooku walks in, regarding the Jedi with a measure of pity and worry. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: Traitor.\\nCOUNT DOOKU: Oh no, my friend. This is a mistake. A terrible mistake. TheyÕve gone too far this time. This is madnessÉ\\nOBI-WAN: I thought you were the leader here, Dooku. \\nCOUNT DOOKU: This had nothing to do with me, I assure you. I promise you, I will petition immediately to have you set free. \\nOBI-WAN: (cynically) Well, I hope it doesnÕt take too long. I have work to do. \\n\\nDooku is disturbed by Obi-WanÕs open hostility and changes tactics. \\n\\nCOUNT DOOKU: May I ask why a Jedi Knight is all the way out here on Geonosis? \\nOBI-WAN: IÕve been tracking a bounty hunter named Jango Fett. Do you know him? \\nCOUNT DOOKU: There are no bounty hunters here that I am aware of. Geonosians donÕt trust them. \\nOBI-WAN: Well, who can blame them? But he is here, I can assure you. \\nCOUNT DOOKU: ItÕs a great pity that our paths have never crossed before, Obi-Wan. Qui-Gon always spoke very highly of you. (quiet) I wish he were still aliveÉI could use his help right now. \\n\\nDooku is genuinely regretful, but Obi-Wan remains defiant. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: Qui-Gon Jinn would never join you!!\\nCOUNT DOOKU: DonÕt be so sure, my young Jedi. You forget that he was once my apprentice, just as you were once his. He knew all about the corruption in the Senate. They all knew. But he would have never gone along with it if he had known the truth as I have. \\nOBI-WAN: The truth?!?\\nCOUNT DOOKU: The truth. (beat) What if I told you that the Republic was now under the control of the Dark Lord of the Sith? \\n\\nObi-Wan is floored by this revelation. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: NO!! ThatÕs not possible!! The Jedi would be aware of it!!\\nCOUNT DOOKU: The Dark Side of the Force has clouded their vision, my friend. Hundreds of Senators are now under the influence of a Sith Lord called Darth Sidious. \\n\\nObi-Wan shakes his head. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: I donÕt believe youÉ\\nCOUNT DOOKU: (passionate) The Viceroy of the Trade Federation was once in league with this Darth Sidious, but he was betrayed ten years ago by the Dark Lord. He came to me for help. He told me everything. The Jedi Council would not believe him. I have tried many times to warn them, but they wouldnÕt listen to me. Once they sense the Dark LordÕs presence and realize their error, it will be too late. You must join me, Obi-WanÉand together we will destroy the Sith!! \\nOBI-WAN: (cold) I will never join you, Dooku. \\n\\nDooku sags, shaking his head. \\n\\nCOUNT DOOKU: It may be difficult to secure your release. \\n\\nHe turns and leaves the room. \\n\\nWIPE TO:\\n\\nINT. GALACTIC SENATE HALL, UPPER CORRIDOR -- EVENING\\n\\nMace Windu walks down an upper corridor and meets Yoda, who is sitting on a ledge overlooking the Senate chamber. Inside the grand rotunda, the uproar is deafening. Senators on opposing sides yell wildly and furiously at each other. \\n\\nMAS AMEDDA: Order!! ORDER!!!\\n\\nFinally, the tumult dies down. \\n\\nPALPATINE: In the regrettable absence of Senator Amidala, the chair recognizes the Senior Representative of NabooÉ Jar Jar Binks.\\n\\nAmid a conflicting storm of cheers and boos, Jar Jar, with Captain Typho, floats his pod to the middle of the vast space. He looks at Palpatine nervously. Palpatine nods. Jar Jar clears his throat. \\n\\nJAR JAR: Itsa clear desa Separtists made a pact witha desa Federation traitors. Senators, dellow felogates... \\n\\nThe Senate explodes with moans, laughter and jeers. Jar Jar blushes.\\n\\nMAS AMEDDA: ORDER!! The Senate will accord the Representative the courtesy of a hearing.\\n\\nThe rotunda goes comparatively quiet. Jar Jar grips the edge of his podium, trying to speak as clearly as possible.\\n\\nINT. CORUSCANT, MAIN SENATE CHAMBER -- EVENING\\n\\nJar Jar stands in his pod as it floats in the middle of the vast space. \\n\\nJAR JAR: In response to dis direct threat to da Republic from da Confederacy of Independent SystemsÉmesa propose dat da Senate gib immediately emergency powers to da Supreme Chancellor. \\n\\nUproar again fills the senate. \\n\\nJAR JAR: Whosa can deny dese are excepteenal times?!? Excepteenal times demand excepteenal measures! Excepteenal measures demand excepteenal men!!!\\n\\nThe pod for Ryloth swings into the center of the chamber.\\n\\nORN FREE TAA: We wonÕt support a dictator!\\n\\nSeveral cheers rise from the Senate. \\n\\nJAR JAR: Dat isa sentiment ebry one of us agrees wid! And whensa da shadow of war hasen dispersed and da bright day of liberty hasen dawned again, da powers wesa now given to da Supreme Chancellor will be gladly, and swiftly returned.\\n\\nThe Senate goes quiet. \\n\\nJAR JAR: Oursa ancient liberties will be restored to usen, burnished eben more brightly dan before! \\n\\nThere is a rolling wave of applause. Jar Jar beams and bows. \\n\\nMAS AMEDDA: Order! We shall have order!\\n\\nThe applause dies down. Palpatine rises.\\n\\nPALPATINE: It is with great reluctance that I have agreed to this calling. I love democracyÉ I love the Republic. The fact that this crisis is demanding I be given absolute power to rule over you is evident. But I am mild by nature and have no desire to see the destruction of democracy. The power you give me I will lay down when this crisis has abated, I promise you. And as my first act with this new authority, I will create a grand army of the Republic to counter the increasing threats of the separatists. \\n\\nThe Senate explodes with cheers. \\n\\nMAS AMEDDA: We shall proceed to the vote. All those in favor of granting emergency powers to the Supreme Chancellor, signal aye at this timeÉ those opposed?\\n\\nThe vote is overwhelming positive, with almost no dissenting votes.\\n \\nINT. GALACTIC SENATE HALL, UPPER CORRIDOR -- EVENING\\n\\nYoda shakes his head sadly. Mace Windu is equally grave. \\n\\nMACE WINDU: It is done then. (beat, then to Yoda) I will take what Jedi we have left and go to Geonosis and help Obi-Wan. \\nYODA: Visit I will the cloners on Kamino, and see this army they have created for the Republic.\\n\\nEXT. SPACE \\n\\nThe Naboo Starship comes out of hyperspace and zooms toward the ringed planet of Geonosis. \\n\\nEXT. GEONOSIS Ð DAY\\n\\nAnakin pilots the starship close to the ground, weaving around towering rock formations. \\n\\nINT. ROYAL CRUISER Ð COCKPIT (GEONOSIS)\\n\\nPADME: (pointing) See those columns of steam straight ahead? TheyÕre exhaust vents of some type. \\nANAKIN: ThatÕll do. \\n\\nEXT. GEONOSIS Ð DAY\\n\\nAnakin pilots the craft straight down into a column, flying through the steam and landing at the bottom.\\n\\nINT. ROYAL CRUISER Ð COCKPIT (GEONOSIS)\\n\\nAnakin and Padme get up from their seats and head for the shipÕs hatch. \\n\\nPADME: Look, whatever happens out there, follow my lead. IÕm not interested in getting into a war here. As a member of the Senate, maybe I can find a diplomatic solution to this mess. \\nANAKIN: DonÕt worry. IÕve give up trying to argue with you. \\n\\nArtoo gives a plaintive wail. \\n\\nTHREEPIO: My obtuse little friend. If they had needed our help, they would have asked for it. You obviously have a great deal to learn about human behavior. \\n \\nINT. GEONOSIS, CORRIDORS Ð DAY\\n\\nAnakin and Padme cautiously proceed into the steam-filled stalagmite city. They stop, looking around in wonder at the emptiness. \\n\\nINT. ROYAL CRUISER COCKPIT (GEONOSIS)\\n\\nArtoo watches them out the window as they vanish from sight, and moans with worry. \\n\\nTHREEPIO: Danger? Oh no, I shouldnÕt think so. It looks like a very dull planet to me. They should be back shortly. Just stop worrying, Artoo. \\n\\nArtoo turns and heads back for the ramp, beeping furiously. Threepio totters after him. \\n\\nTHREEPIO: For a mechanic, you seem to do an excessive amount of thinking. I am programmed to understand humans. \\n\\nArtoo bursts out a few short and curt beeps. \\n\\nTHREEPIO: ÒWhat does that mean?Ó That means I am in charge here! \\n\\nArtoo starts down the landing ramp. \\n\\nTHREEPIO: Hey! Where are you going now?!? You donÕt know whatÕs out there!! Have you no sense at all?!?\\n\\nArtoo blatts at him. \\n\\nTHREEPIO: Oh, idiot!\\n\\nINT. GEONOSIS, CORRIDORS, NABOO STARSHIP -- DAY\\n\\nThreepio watches from the hatch as Artoo rolls down the ramp. Artoo gains speed as he touches the rocky ground of Geonosis and rolls away. \\n\\nTHREEPIO: Please wait! Do you know where youÕre going?!? \\n\\nThreepio reluctantly starts down the ramp after the little droid. \\n\\nINT. GEONOSIS, CORRIDORS Ð DAY\\n\\nAnakin and Padme continue on. High above them, at the top of the stalagmites, the rock formations seem to swell and pulse. Then several winged creatures detach themselves from the rocks and swoop down towards the coupleÉ\\n\\nANAKIN: WaitÉ\\n\\nAnakin spins around as one of the winged creatures attacks him. Lightsaber blazing, Anakin cuts down three creatures as Padme exits through a far doorway. \\n\\nINT. GEONOSIS, DROID FOUNDRY Ð DAY\\n\\nAnakin reaches Padme, and they both stand on the edge of a short walkway extending over a deep crevasse. The door behind them closes, stranding the two. The walkway retracts and Padme slips and then jumps down onto a conveyor belt leading into the droid factory.\\n\\nANAKIN: PADME!!!\\n\\nAnakin jumps down and slashes more winged creatures while attempting to reach Padme. One of the creatures is crushed by a falling stamper. Padme makes her way across stamping machines and welders, timing her moves and dodging the machines as Anakin follows, beating back winged creatures. \\n\\nBack up above, Threepio and Artoo have appeared at the entranceway to the foundry.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Oh my goodness! Shut me down -- machines creating machines! How perverse!  \\n\\nArtoo whistles in fury and bumps Threepio. The taller droid teeters at the edge, but regains his footing\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Calm down, Artoo! I almost fell. YouÕll get your chance -- \\n\\nArtoo bumps even harder and pushes Threepio off the small ledge and onto a flying Conveyor Droid. \\n\\nTHREEPIO: IÕM SCRAP!! ITÕS A NIGHTMARE!!! I WANT TO GO HOME!!!\\n\\nFlailing and screaming, Threepio is plucked off the droid and thrown onto the conveyor belt. \\n\\nTHREEPIO: (groan) What did I do to deserve thisÉ??\\n\\nBack at the ledge, two rocket jets shoot out of ArtooÕs sides and the little robot flies up and into the factory. \\n\\nAnakin continues to work his way towards Padme, lightsaber flashing, winged creatures attacking from all directions. Padme wrestles with one Creature, and is thrown into a large empty vat moving down the assembly line. Mechanized arms carry the vat to a position where molten metal\\nwill be poured into it. Padme struggles to find handholds for escape, but is unsuccessful. Artoo sees this and flies towards Padme.\\n\\nSee-Threepio, meanwhile, is walking down a walkway beside a conveyor belt. \\n\\nTHREEPIO: Hmm. I wonder whatÕs happened to poor little Artoo. HeÕs always getting himself into trouble -- \\n\\nSuddenly a robot arm swings across and smashes ThreepioÕs head from his body!! \\n\\nTHREEPIOÕS HEAD: OH NO!!!\\n\\nHis head lands in a line of Battle Droid heads. ThreepioÕs headless body walks blindly into another assembly line, sandwiched between Battle Droids. A Battle Droid head is welded onto ThreepioÕs body.  \\n\\nBATTLE DROID HEAD: Uh ohÉ\\n\\nMeanwhile, ThreepioÕs head is picked by a robot arm and moved into another assembly line where it is welded onto a Battle DroidÕs body. \\n\\nTHREEPIOÕS HEAD: IÕm so confusedÉ\\n\\nMeanwhile, Anakin continues to battle creatures. He is knocked to the ground by a robot arm, and his right arm becomes locked and welded into a loading device. Anakin comes closer and closer to the cutting machineÉ\\n\\nAs Padme continues her struggle to escape the vat, Artoo finds the computer port controlling the vat and programs PadmeÕs to dump her out onto a walkway. \\n\\nAnakin ignites his lightsaber in an attempt to free his arm. The cutter approaches -- he maneuvers his body away from the cutter, but it slams down and cuts his lightsaber in half. He regains his feet and swings at a robot arm Ð then realizes heÕs only holding half of his weapon. \\n\\nANAKIN: Not again!! Obi-WanÕs gonna kill meÉ\\n\\nWinged creatures and several droidekas surround Anakin and Padme on all sides. Jango Fett swoops down from the sky on his jetpack, blaster aimed at the both of them. \\n\\nJANGO FETT: DonÕt move, Jedi!\\n\\nThe group of winged creatures part to reveal Count Dooku. He bows to them in greeting. \\n\\nCOUNT DOOKU: Senator Amidala. IÕve heard so much about you. \\nPADME: Count Dooku, I presume. \\nCOUNT DOOKU: IÕm delighted to finally meet you. We have so much to talk about. Come. \\n\\nHe gestures for the two to follow him. \\n\\nCOUNT DOOKU: I hope you can keep your young Jedi under control. \\nPADME: DonÕt worry, heÕs housebroken. \\nJANGO FETT: (to the droidekas) Take him away!\\n\\nAnakin glares at Padme as they follow the Count out of the clearing. \\n\\nINT. CONFERENCE ROOM (GEONOSIS) Ð DAY\\n\\nAnakin and Padme are led into a large conference room. Count Dooku sits across from them, with Jango next to him. Ten Geonosian guards are spread throughout the room. \\n\\nPADME: You are holding a Jedi Knight, Obi-Wan Kenobi. I am formally requesting you turn him over to me Ð now. \\nCOUNT DOOKU: He has been convicted of espionage, Senator, and will be executed. In just a few hours, I believe. \\n\\nAnakin and Padme are stunned. Dooku smiles. \\n\\nPADME: He is an officer of the Republic!! You canÕt do that!!\\nCOUNT DOOKU: We donÕt recognize the Republic here, Senator. But if Naboo were to join our Alliance, I could easily hear your plea for clemencyÉ\\n\\nAnakin grits his teeth. \\n\\nPADME: And if I donÕt join your rebellion, I assume this Jedi with me will also die? \\nCOUNT DOOKU: I donÕt wish to make you join our cause against your will, Senator. But you are a rational, honest representative of your peopleÉand I assume you want to do whatÕs in their best interest. ArenÕt they fed up with the corruption, the bureaucrats, the hypocrisy of it all? ArenÕt you? Be honest, Senator. \\n\\nPadme hesitates before replying. \\n\\nPADME: The ideals are still alive, Count. Even if the institution is failing. \\n\\nDookuÕs smile grows wider. \\n\\nCOUNT DOOKU: You believe in the same ideals we believe in! The same ideals we are striving to make prominent. \\nPADME: If what you say is true, you should stay in the Republic and help Chancellor Palpatine put things right. \\nCOUNT DOOKU: I admit the Chancellor means well, MÕLady. But he is incompetent. He has promised to cut the bureaucracy. But here it is, ten years later, and the bureaucrats are stronger than ever, no? The Republic cannot be fixed, MÕLady. It is time to start over. The democratic process in the Republic is a sham, no? A shell game played on the voters. The time will come when the cult of greed called Ôthe RepublicÕ will lose even the pretext of democracy and freedom. \\n\\nPadme is shaken by the CountÕs sincere words. \\n\\nPADME: I cannot believe that. I know of your treaties with the Trade Federation, the Commerce Guilds, and the others. What is happening here is not government that has been bought out by businessÉitÕs business becoming government! I will not forsake all that I have honored and worked for and betray the Republic.\\nCOUNT DOOKU: Then you will betray your Jedi friends? Without your cooperation, I can do nothing to stop their execution. \\nPADME: And in that statement lies the truth of your proposed Ôimprovement.Õ \\n\\nA flash of terrifying anger crosses DookuÕs face for a moment; then he is his calm and regal self again. \\n\\nPADME: What about me? Am I to be executed as well? \\nCOUNT DOOKU: (patronizing) I wouldnÕt think of such an offense. But there are individuals who have a strong interest in your demise, MÕLady. It has nothing to do with politics, IÕm afraid. ItÕs purely personal, and they have already paid great sums to have you assassinated. IÕm sure they will push hard to have you included in the executions. IÕm sorry, but if you are not going to cooperate I must turn you over to the Geonosians for justice. Without your cooperation, IÕve done all I can for you. \\nPADME: (scoffs) ÒJusticeÓÉ\\nJANGO FETT: Take them away. \\n\\nAnakin and Padme are hauled out of the room by Geonosian guards. \\n\\nINT. GEONOSIS, HIGH AUDIENCE CHAMBER Ð DAY\\n\\nAnakin and Senator Amidala are taken into the center of what looks like a courtroom. Seated before them, in a tall boxed-off area, are many of the separatist leaders of their respective worlds. Count Dooku; Archduke Poggle the Lesser; Senators Po Nudo, Tessek and Toonbuck Toora; Commerce dignitaries Shu Mai, Nute Gunray of the Trade Federation, Passel Argente, Wat Tambor, and finally San Hill of the Intergalactic Bank Clan. Along the wall, about a HUNDRED GEONOSIANS wait for a verdict.\\n\\nSUN FAC: You have been charged and found guilty of espionage. \\nPOGGLE: (subtitled) Have you anything to say before your sentence is carried out? \\nPADME: YouÕre committing an act of war, Archduke! I hope youÕre prepared for the consequences! \\n\\nPoggle laughs, and Count Dooku smiles.  \\n\\nPOGGLE: (subtitled) We build weapons of war Ð it is our business! Of course we are prepared!\\nNUTE: (annoyed) Get on with it. Carry out the sentence. I want to see her suffer. \\nPOGGLE: (subtitled) Your other Jedi friend is waiting for you, SenatorÉ take them to the arena!\\n\\nFour guards take hold of Anakin and Padme, and they are dragged out to the sound of the ConfederacyÕs laughter. \\n\\nINT. GEONOSIS TUNNEL TO EXECUTION ARENA - DAY\\n\\nIn a gloomy tunnel, Anakin and Padme are tossed into an open cart. The murmur of a vast crowd is heard offscreen. GUARDS extend their arms along the framework and tie them so that they stand facing each other. The DRIVER gets up onto his seat. \\n\\nANAKIN: DonÕt be afraid. \\nPADME: (whisper) IÕm not afraid to die. IÕve been dying a little bit each day since you came back into my life. \\n\\nA beat. \\n\\nANAKIN: What are you talking aboutÉ? \\nPADME: I love you. \\n\\nAnakinÕs eyes go wide. \\n\\nANAKIN: You love me?!? I thought that we had decided not to fall in love. That we would be forced to live a lie. And that it would destroy our livesÉ \\nPADME: Look around. I think our lives are about to be destroyed anyway. (beat) My love for you is a puzzle, Ani, for which I have no answers. I canÕt control itÉand now I donÕt care to. I truly, deeply love you, and before we die I want you to know. \\n\\nPadme leans toward Anakin. Straining, itÕs just barely possible for their lips to meet. \\n\\nANAKIN: (breathless) I have no desire to be cured of this love either. Long or short, I vow to spend the rest of my life with you.  \\n\\nThey kiss again. The music swells...\\n\\nThe driver cracks his whip over the ORRAY harnessed between the shafts. The cart jerks forward, breaking the kiss. Suddenly, there is a HUGE ROAR and blinding sunlight as they emerge into the arena.\\n\\nEXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY\\n\\nThe great stadium is packed with tier upon tier of yelling Geonosians. The cart carrying Anakin and Padme stops in the middle of the arena near six tall columns. Padme quickly pulls a wire from her clothing and places it in her mouth. Obi-Wan stands with his hands bound overhead by chains to the fourth column. The Geonosian guard cuffs Padme to the second column and then escorts Anakin in chains to the third between Padme and Obi-Wan. Anakin looks over to his master. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: I was beginning to wonder if youÕd got my message. \\nANAKIN: I retransmitted it, just as you requested, Master... \\n\\nObi-Wan gives him a cold stare. \\n\\nANAKIN:  ... then we decided to come and rescue you. \\n\\nThe Geonosian guard lifts Anakin\\'s hands above his head and into the restraints. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: (sarcasm) Good job. \\n\\nAnakin gives Obi-Wan an icy stare of his own, then looks straight ahead. A second Geonosian comes to Padme and begins adjusting her hand restraints as well. She is looking at Anakin. The cart is wheeled away. \\n\\nThere is another roar as Poggle the Lesser, Count Dooku, Nute Gunray, the Fetts, and dignitaries arrive in the Archducal box and take their places. \\n\\nPOGGLE: (subtitled) Settle down, settle downÉ\\n\\nThe crowd quiets down.\\n\\nSUN FAC: The felons before you have been convicted of espionage against the Sovereign System of Geonosis. Their sentence of death is to be carried out in this public arena henceforth.\\n\\nThe crowd ROARS and CHEERS. \\n\\nPOGGLE: (subtitled) Let the executions begin.\\n\\nThe crowd goes wild. \\n\\nFrom different gates around the arena, three monsters are driven in. They are the REEK (bull-like), the NEXU (lion-like) and the ACKLAY (a kind of dino-lobster). They are driven by PICADORS carrying long electric spears and riding Orrays. The Nexu jumps and eats the Picador prodding it, only to be shocked by the poles of two others.\\n\\nANAKIN: IÕve got a bad feeling about thisÉ\\n\\nThe Picadors poke the monsters toward the center of the arena, and then retire to the perimeter. The monsters toss their heads, looking around, roaring and screeching. Then they catch sight of the three captives and start moving towards them.  \\n\\nOBI-WAN: Just relax, concentrate. Take the one on the right. IÕll take the one on the left. \\nANAKIN: What about Padme? \\n\\nPadme has used the wire she concealed to pick the lock on one of her hand restraints. She spins around and pulls herself up by the chain to the top of the post. Within a moment she is standing on top of it, trying to pull the chain free. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: (drily) She seems to be on top of things. \\n\\nObi-Wan ducks around the post as the Acklay charges at him. It knocks the post flat, sending Obi-Wan sprawling. The Acklay crunches the post between itsÕ claws, freeing Obi-WanÕs chain. Obi-Wan leaps up and runs at one of the Picadors. The Acklay takes off after him.\\n\\nThe Reek charges at Anakin. He leaps up, and the beast hits the post hard. Anakin lands on itsÕ back, wrapping part of his chain around itsÕ horn. The Reek backs off, shaking itsÕ head angrily. The shaking tears the chain from the post. \\n\\nThe Nexu arrives at PadmeÕs post and rears on its hind legs. Up top, Padme struggles to tear her chain free. The Nexu roars, displaying wicked dripping fangs. The NexuÕs claws dig deep into PadmeÕs post. Padme hits the creature with her chain and it backs off down the pole. With a single leap, the creature reaches the top and slashes at Padme. She turns and the claw catches her shirt, ripping off the lower half, and gouging huge bloody scratches into her back. She screams in agony.\\n\\nUp at the Archducal box, Nute Gunray is rubbing his hands in glee, laughing like a school boy.\\n\\nObi-Wan is rolling on the ground for his life, barely one step ahead of the screeching Acklay and itsÕ claw that repeatedly sinks into the ground where he was a second ago.\\n\\nAnakinÕs Reek starts to buck. It charges around the arena with Anakin hanging on for dear life. He whirls the free length of his chin around his head and casts it into the ReekÕs mouth. ItsÕ jaws clamp hard on the chain. Anakin yanks back on the chain, turning the Reek, beginning to ride it. But the creature is too wild and rough, and Anakin is thrown from the creatureÕs back and dragged across the sandy ground by the chain.\\n  \\nPadme jumps off the post into the air. She swings around on the chain and whacks the beast hard on the head with both her feet. It tumbles back onto the sand. Padme climbs back up the pole, scrambling to the top. \\n\\nThe crowd begins to boo. Up in the Archuducal box, Nute Gunray is outraged. \\n\\nNUTE: FOUL!! She canÕt do that!! Shoot her or something!! \\n\\nObi-Wan finds an Orray-riding Picador trying to spear him down. The Orray rears up. Obi-Wan grabs the PicadorÕs long spear and pole vaults over him. The chasing Acklay smashes into the Orray, taking it down. The Picador tumbles onto the sand, where he is grabbed by the Acklay and crunched. \\n\\nThe Reek finally comes to a stop, and Anakin regains his feet. He walks slowly towards the creature, hands out, trying to calm and tame it with the power of the Force. Finally he leaps back atop it and rides it again. \\n\\nThe Nexu springs up and braces to leap up at Padme again. She finally manages to work the chain loose. Anakin comes charging up on the Reek and gores the Nexu, killing it. \\n\\nANAKIN: You okay? \\n\\nPadme nods, gasping. \\n\\nPADME: Sure!\\nANAKIN: Jump!!!\\n\\nPadme leaps from the top of the post to land on the Reek behind Anakin. She kisses him on the cheek. The Reek charges away across the arena. \\n\\nObi-Wan runs out from behind the fallen Orray and throws the spear at the Acklay, hitting it in the neck. It lets out a terrible screech and bites down on the spear, yanking it out of itsÕ side and snapping it in two. The Reek passes Obi-Wan. Obi-Wan runs and jumps on the back of the Reek behind Anakin and Padme. \\n\\nIn the Archducal box, Nute Gunray turns angrily to Count Dooku. \\n\\nNUTE GUNRAY: This isnÕt how itÕs supposed to be!! I want her DEAD!! Jango, finish her off!!\\n\\nJango gets up, but a smiling Dooku gently puts him back down with one arm. HeÕs clearing enjoying the spectacle. \\n\\nCOUNT DOOKU: (enigmatic smile) Patience, Viceroy, patience Ð she will die. \\n\\nEXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA Ð DAY \\n\\nDroidekas roll to the center of the arena where they transform into battle configuration and surround the Reek, containing Padme and the Jedi. \\n\\nBehind Count Dooku and the three other dignitaries, in the entrance to the Archducal section, a flash of light appears and knocks out one of the Geonosian guards. This event goes unnoticed by the four spectators. \\n\\nA dark hand then taps DookuÕs shoulder. Dooku turns around asÉ Mace Windu reveals himself while holding Jango at bay with his purple-bladed lightsaber. Dooku masks his surprise elegantly. \\n\\nCOUNT DOOKU: Master Windu, how pleasant of you to join us. You\\'re just in time for the moment of truth. I would think these two new boys of yours could use a little more training.\\nMACE WINDU: Sorry to disappoint you, Dooku. This partyÕs over. \\n\\nMace signals. At strategic areas in the arena there are sudden flashes of light as about ONE HUNDRED JEDI enter from all passageways, lightsabers ignited. The crowd is suddenly silent. Count DookuÕs lips curl in slight amusement.\\n\\nCOUNT DOOKU: Brave but, uhÉ foolish, my old Jedi friend. You\\'re impossibly outnumbered.\\nMACE WINDU: I don\\'t think so. The Geonosians arenÕt warriors. One Jedi has to be worth a hundred Geonosians.\\n\\nDooku looks around the great theater, his smile growing.\\n\\nCOUNT DOOKU: WeÕll see.\\n\\nDooku signalsÉ. and THOUSANDS OF DROIDS start to pour into all parts of the arena!! Mace turns as the army (battle droids, destroyer droids, and even super battle droids) emerge from the dark passageway behind them. CUT TO a HIGH ANGLE of the VIP box as droids are coming from all entrances in the remote area. \\n\\nMace is surrounded. Jango backs out of firing range. The droids then unmercifully open fire. Mace deflects the first few bolts as Dooku and the other dignitaries attempt to move to safer ground. \\n\\nThe droids continue to fire as Mace deflects the bolts right back at them. WIDE SHOT of Mace as he spins and deflects shots from all sides. A number of droids are smashed back by their own bolts. \\n\\nJango then brings up his flamethrower and fires at Mace. Geonosians fly away in the background. Mace leaps as the flame scorches the area where he was, but his cloak catches on fire. Jango then blasts at Mace in the air. Mace deflects all the bolts as he flips in mid air and down into the arena, his cloak still on fire. Once on the ground of the arena, Mace throws off his burning cloak. From the Archducal box, Boba Fett watches the unfolding battle. \\n\\nWIDE SHOT as Jedi fight for their lives against the superior number of droids. Two Jedi leap from another box just as itÕs blasted by droids. MORE SHOTS of Jedi defending themselves from attacks on all sides. One Jedi destroys a Super Droid but is suddenly gunned down by a Destroyer Droid. The airborne Geonosians fire ray guns down at the Jedi, and they prove much more difficult to deflect. \\n\\nThreepioÕs body with the battle droid head enters the arena. \\n\\nBATTLE DROID HEAD: My legs arenÕt moving. I must need maintenance.\\n\\nSeveral Jedi run to the center of the arena and throw lightsabers to Obi-Wan and Anakin. A blast rocks the Reek, and the three tumble off. Padme jumps on top of the Orray pulling the execution wagon. Anakin runs, jumps and lands in the cart, deflecting laser blasts with his lightsaber. Padme blasts battle droids as the two ride through the arena.\\n\\nThe battle droid body with ThreepioÕs head enters the arena, carrying a blaster rifle and firing at the Jedi. \\n\\nTHREEPIO: WhatÕs all this noise?!? Oh Ð a battle!! There must be some terrible mistake! IÕm programmed for etiquette, not destruction!!!\\n\\nMace Windu runs to the center of the arena and fights back-to-back with Obi-Wan, as they swipe and mangle droids.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Someone\\'s got to shut down these droids!!\\nMACE WINDU: Don\\'t worry! It\\'s being taken care of!\\n\\nEXT. GEONOSIS, FEDERATION STARSHIP - DAY\\nKi-Adi-Mundi leads a raiding party of about TWENTY JEDI through the lines of parked Core Starships. They cut a swath through masses of Droids until they arrive at the Command Core Starship. Some Jedi fall. The rest cut their way up the ramps and into the Command Ship.\\n\\nINT. COMMAND FEDERATION STARSHIP, CORRIDORS - DAY\\n\\nKi-Adi-Mundi and the surviving Jedi fight their way through the corridors of the Command Ship, deflecting laser bolts, slicing Droids.\\n\\nEXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA Ð DAY\\n\\nThe body of Threepio with the battle droid head is fired upon and knocked back to the ground. The battle droid head goes flying off ThreepioÕs body. COLEMAN TREBOR, one of the Jedi Council, leaps into the Archducal box and swings at Count Dooku, but is repeatedly shot and sent falling to the arena floor by JangoÕs blaster. Jango coolly twirls his blaster and replaces it on his holster. \\n\\nThe Reek charges, separating Obi-Wan and Mace Windu. The beast chases Mace across the arena. Mace swipes at the Reek, chopping off one of itsÕ horns. The Reek still catches Mace with its shoulder, sending Mace sprawling and losing his lightsaber. Jango Fett, watching from above, rockets down and lands behind him in the arena. Mace grabs his lightsaber, and the Reek tosses Jango away. Jango ends up under the Reek, avoiding the creatureÕs massive hoofs. Finally Fett is free and kills the Reek. \\n\\nJango stands and whips around looking for Mace with both blasters raised. Mace leaps down from the stands and charges forward. Jango desperately opens fire but Mace deflects all the bolts as he runs. Mace lunges with his lightsaber at Jango\\'s head and Jango ducks, but is left off balance. Jango manages one blast from his arm-mounted blaster, but it misses. Mace spins and slices across and downward. \\n\\nJango\\'s helmet, with his head still inside, bounces and rolls in the dust. His body falls to the dirt.\\n\\nINT. COMMAND FEDERATION STARSHIP, CONTROL BRIDGE Ð DAY\\n\\nKi-Adi-Mundi and his group of Jedi burst onto the bridge and chop down the command droids. The Neimoidians flee in all directions. Ki-Adi-Mundi leans over the control panel. He locates the illuminated master switch and punches down on it. It goes dark. Instantly, all the droids on the Starship FREEZE! \\n\\nEXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA Ð DAY\\n\\nAll the droids in the arena freeze as well. There is a moment of stunned silence, then the Jedi cheer. \\n\\nINT. COMMAND FEDERATION STARSHIP, CONTROL BRIDGE Ð DAY\\n\\nOn the bridge, Plo Koon claps Ki-Adi-Mundi on the back.\\n\\nPLO KOON: We\\'ve done it! Now we have a chance!\\n\\nSuddenly, there is a harsh beeping sound. All the droids on the Starship start fighting again! Ki-Adi-Mundi stares in disbelief and dismay.\\n\\nEXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA Ð DAY\\n\\nThe droids in the arena have started fighting again as well, and the Jedi are even harder pressed. The Threepio/Battle Droid continues to fire on the Jedi, hitting and killing several. \\n\\nTHREEPIOÕS HEAD: (battle droid voice) DIE, JEDI DOGS!! (normal voice) Oh Ð what did I say?!?\\n\\nUp in the Archducal Box, Nute and Rune cringe and jump from several near-miss blaster bolts. \\n\\nAmong the tiers, the Jedi are slowly being driven back and whittled down. They have killed heaps of Geonosians and knocked out piles of droids, but the sheer numbers are telling. Individual Jedi are being cut down or blasted. The rest continue to retreat into the arena. \\n\\nTHREEPIOÕS HEAD: Oh dear, IÕm terribly sorry about all thisÉ\\n\\nThe Jedi Master KIT FISTO uses the Force to knock the Threepio/Battle Droid backward onto the arena floor. A downed Super battle droid falls on top of ThreepioÕs battle droid body, pinning him to the ground. Fisto grins and rejoins the battle. \\n\\nTHREEPIOÕS HEAD: Excuse me? IÕm trapped, I canÕt get upÉ\\n\\nA droideka nails and kills the Orray, knocking the execution cart to the ground. Anakin wields his lightsaber and Padme uses a blaster rifle to defend themselves, using the fallen execution wagon for protection. \\n\\nANAKIN: You call this a Òdiplomatic solutionÓ? \\nPADME: (grins) No, I call it Òaggressive negotiationsÓ!  \\n\\nObi-Wan dodges the fire of two battle droidsÉwho suddenly move back in the cybernetic equivalent of panic. \\n\\nBATTLE DROID #1: Uh oh!!\\nBATTLE DROID #2: Roger roger!!\\n\\nObi-Wan turns and faces the irate Acklay. But this time heÕs ready Ð swinging his lightsaber, he chops off two of the creatureÕs claws and slices into itsÕ side. The Acklay sags to the ground, moaning. Obi-Wan brings his blade over his head and skewers the AcklayÕs skull. \\n\\nArtoo finds the battle droid body with ThreepioÕs head attached. \\n\\nTHREEPIO: Artoo, what are you doing here?\\n\\nHe shoots a projectile from his body that attaches a suction device to ThreepioÕs head, and pulls the head away from the battle droid. \\n\\nTHREEPIO: What are you doing?!? Stop that! YouÕre going to strain something Ð my head!! Now where are you taking me?? Oh, this is such a dragÉIÕm quite beside myself. \\n\\nArtoo drags ThreepioÕs head across the arena and reattaches it to ThreepioÕs body, using an extendable welding arm. \\n\\nTHREEPIO: Artoo, please be careful! YouÕre singeing my circuits. Is my head on straight? \\n\\nSoon, the fifteen exhausted remaining Jedi (plus Obi-Wan, Anakin and Padme) are completely hemmed in to the center of the arena by countless battle droids. The bloodied sand around them is strewn with the bodies of dead Geonosians, shattered droids, and Jedi. \\n\\nSilence. Dooku lifts his hand, and the droids lower their weapons.\\n\\nKi-Adi-Mundi and the survivors from the raiding party are herded into the group by Super Battle Droids. From the encircling tiers above, thousands of battle droids level their weapons menacingly. The Jedi group forms a small defensive circle, ready to fight to the last man. \\n\\nCOUNT DOOKU: Master Windu, you have fought gallantly. Worthy of recognition in the archives of the Jedi Order. NowÉ it is finished.  (pauses briefly) Surrender - and your lives will be spared.\\nMACE WINDU: We will not be hostages to be bartered, Dooku! \\n\\nAgain, a shadow of genuine grief and regret crosses DookuÕs face. Momentarily. \\n\\nCOUNT DOOKU: ThenÉ IÕm sorry, old friend. You will all have to be destroyed. \\n\\nThe droids raise their weapons. Anakin and Padme look hopelessly at each other, and the Jedi raise their lightsabers and brace themselves for the last stand. Dooku lifts his hand to give the attack order --\\n\\nPADME: LOOK!!!\\n\\nAmidala points up to the sky -- six giant assault/attack gunships descend into and around the arena. They set down in a cluster around the handful of Jedi. Upon landing, thousands of clonetroopers emerge from these six ships and start firing up at the droids. There is a hellstorm of laser fire that bounces off the laser shields created by the Gunships. Yoda appears at the door of one of the Gunships. \\n\\nYODA: Around the survivors a perimeter create!! \\nMACE WINDU: JEDI, MOVE!!!!\\n\\nThe surviving Jedi dash to the Gunships and scramble in. Mace Windu hangs on tight and blocks blaster fire with his lightsaber (as does Ki-Adi Mundi) as the Gunship, firing all itsÕ weapons, rises out of the arena up and over the topmost rim. Grimacing, Dooku turns and walks into the inner corridors of the arena. \\n\\nOn the arena grounds, Artoo beeps as Threepio tries to sit up. \\n\\nTHREEPIO: OhÉwhat happened? I had the most peculiar dreamÉ\\n\\nIn another part of the deserted arena, Boba Fett finds his fatherÕs battered helmet. Sinking to his knees, he picks it up and touches it gently to his forehead. He lowers his head in sorrow. \\n\\nEXT. GEONOSIS, TERRAIN OUTSIDE EXECUTION ARENA Ð DAY\\n\\nOutside on the flat terrain below, a line of parked Trade Federation and Commerce Guild Battle Ships and legions of Battle Droids surround the arena. However, dozens of giant wedge-shaped Republic warships begin to land on the countryside surrounding them. \\n\\nThe Republic Gunships carrying the Jedi circle towering stalagmites as they head toward the assembly point. Winged Geonosians fire laser cannons up at the Gunships. \\n\\nINT. GUNSHIP NUMBER ONE -- DAY\\n\\nMace Windu stares down at the incredible sight. \\n\\nYODA: If escapes Dooku does, rally more systems to his cause he will. Capture him we must.\\n\\nINT.

BATTLEFIELD, GEONOSIS LANDSCAPE Ð DAY\\n\\nGunship #2 skims the battlefield, firing down, deflecting answering fire from the droids. \\n \\nINT. GUNSHIP NUMBER TWO Ð DAY\\n\\nObi-Wan, Anakin and Padme watch from the open Gunship. On the battleground below, Clone Troopers riding speeder bikes advance toward the battlefield. Trade Federation Spider Droids fire at the Clone Troopers and Republic Gunships. Lightsaber-wielding Jedi slash through Battle Droids. The battle rages on. \\n\\nGunship #1 flies low toward Techno Union starships. \\n\\nANAKIN: Aim right above the fuel cells. \\n\\nLaser fire pelts the base of the Techno Union ship. Rocked with explosions, it begins to tilt over and the Gunships split up, flying past. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: Good call, my young Padawan! \\n\\nEXT. BATTLEFIELD, GEONOSIS LANDSCAPE Ð DAY\\n\\nThe landed Republic warships begin to spew out thousands of LAAT/iÕs (Troop Gunships), LAAT/CÕs (Cargo Gunships), and AT-TEÕs (Walker Tanks) as well as hundreds of thousands of Clone Troopers. \\n\\nThe Clonetroopers open fire with artillery. Explosions caused by the Gunships wreck the parked Battleships. The Gunships open the rear of their ships and release hundreds of Military Swoops and the Cargo Gunships carry the Walker Tanks laden with troopers into the midst of the battleground.\\n\\nINT. GEONOSIS, COMMAND CENTER Ð DAY\\n\\nPoggle, Dooku, Nute and RUNE HAAKO rush into a huge command center. In the center of the room there is a large circular holo-viewscreen and around the perimeter of the room Geonosian soldiers monitor the Clone ArmyÕs advances on large semitransparent maps. In one corner of the room there is a large monitor flashing a variety of images, like schematics to a planet-sized mechanized superweapon.\\n\\nNUTE GUNRAY: The Jedi have amassed a huge army! \\nCOUNT DOOKU: Where did they get them? That doesnÕt seem possible. How could the Jedi come up with an army so quickly? \\nNUTE GUNRAY: We must send all available droids into battle! \\n\\nDooku shakes his head. \\n\\nCOUNT DOOKU: There are too many. They will soon have us surrounded. \\n\\nIn the near distance, a massive explosion. \\n\\nPOGGLE: (subtitled) Our communications have been jammed.

Mace Windu, Ki-Adi-Mundi, Kit Fisto and Clone Troopers spill from the Gunship. A Clone Captain runs up to Mace. \\n\\nCLONE CAPTAIN: Sir, I have five special commando units awaiting your orders, sir. \\n\\nMace nods and points in the direction of the growing battlefield. Still on the Gunship, Yoda shouts at the pilot. \\n\\nYODA: To the forward command center take me!!\\n\\nGunship #1 lifts off with Yoda on board. Mace and the Jedi join the swarms of Clone Troopers in the ground battle. The two forces close in on each other, filling the skies with laser fire and smoke. \\n\\nINT. GUNSHIP NUMBER ONE Ð DAY\\n\\nFrom his vantage point at the open door, Yoda watches the battle unfold below him. The Clone Troopers open fire with artillery. Explosions wreck the parked Battle Starships. Clone Troopers advance, firing at the massed droids. Droid starfighters fly overhead, exchanging fire with the Gunships and Jedi Starfighters. \\n\\nYODA: More battalions to the left. Encircle them we must, then divide.\\n\\nINT. GUNSHIP NUMBER TWO Ð DAY\\n\\nStill on his Gunship with Anakin and Padme, Obi-Wan points outward. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: Target those Federation starships quickly!! \\n\\nOne Trade Federation starship begins to rise from itsÕ docking port. Gunship #2 and another Gunship fires on the starship, with no apparent damage. \\n\\nANAKIN: TheyÕre too big, Master. The ground troops will have to take them out. \\n\\nINT. GUNSHIP NUMBER ONE Ð DAY\\n\\nGunship #1 lands at the makeshift Command Center.

BATTLEFIELD, GEONOSIS LANDSCAPE Ð DAY\\n\\nSeveral Cargo Gunships land just long enough to drop AT-TEÕs from their bellies and then lift off again. Several rolling Confederacy anti-air droids try to shoot the Gunships out of the sky. \\n\\nINT. GEONOSIS, COMMAND CENTER Ð DAY\\n\\nDooku, Poggle, Nute and Rune stand around the viewscreen. The screen shows the ConfederacyÕs droid army slowly being overcome by the Republic clone army. \\n\\nNUTE GUNRAY: This is not looking good at allÉ\\nRUNE HAAKO: We must order the starships back into space. \\n\\nNute and Rune turn and run out of the room. \\n\\nPOGGLE: (subtitled) We have to order a retreat. \\nCOUNT DOOKU: IÕm going to Coruscant. My master will never let the Republic get away with this treachery. \\nPOGGLE: (subtitled) IÕm sending my warriors to hide in the catacombs.\\n\\nAs Dooku waits, Poggle crosses to the holographic schematic. With a few keystrokes, he downloads the image into a small holoprojector and hands it to Dooku. \\n\\nPOGGLE: The Jedi must not find our designs for the ultimate weapon. If they find out what we are planning to build, weÕre doomed. \\n\\nDooku activates the holoprojector and regards the moon-sized battle station thoughtfully. \\n\\nCOUNT DOOKU: I will take the designs with me to Coruscant. They will be much safer there with my master. \\n\\nWith a bow, the Count sweeps out of the room. \\n\\nEXT. GEONOSIS LANDSCAPE Ð DAY\\n\\nThe Gunships rain hellfire down on the battle droids and anti-air rolling droids as they rush toward the launching Federation core ships. The Confederacy forces are slowly being whittled down.\\n\\nINT. CATACOMB HANGAR Ð DAY\\n\\nNute Gunray and Rune Haako rush up into their Neimoidian shuttle. The shuttle rises and shoots out of the catacomb hangar into the sky. Nearby, Count Dooku mounts a speeder bike and sets out onto the rocky landscape with two Geonosian starfighters as escort. \\n\\nINT. GUNSHIP NUMBER TWO Ð DAY\\n\\nThe Gunships continues to fire on the Trade Federation Core ships. The core ships continue to lift into the sky.\\n\\nEXT.

(to his troops) All quadrants to Sector 515!!\\n\\nSeveral ground artillery ships open fire on the rising core ship, spearing it with blue laser fire. The Trade Federation core ship finally begins to weaken under the constant fire. The starship begins to fall and then crashes into the ground, causing a tsunami of dust to cover the battlefield. \\n\\nINT. GUNSHIP NUMBER TWO Ð DAY\\n\\nObi-Wan, Anakin and Padme are at the open sides of Gunship #2 as it flies through the massive dust cloud. Clones fire down at the droids below. The dust is filled with red and blue laser bolts.\\n\\nThe Gunship slows, circling over a droid gun-emplacement. It blasts it, but suddenly the Gunship is rocked by a near miss. It lurches violently.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Look over there!!\\n\\nThrough the other side of the Gunship, they see a Geonosian Speeder Bike racing past. On the bike is the unmistakable figure of Count Dooku.\\n\\nANAKIN: It\\'s Dooku!! Shoot him down!!\\nCLONE CAPTAIN: WeÕre out of rockets, sir. \\nANAKIN: Follow him!\\nPADME: WeÕre going to need some help! \\nOBI-WAN: There isnÕt time!! Anakin and I can handle this!!!! \\n\\nDooku signals the two starfighters flanking his ship. They veer off left and right, loop around, and come up under our heroesÕ Gunship. To avoid the Beakwing fire, the Gunship banks up a steep dune but is still hit. The gunship lurches on its side, and a screaming Padme and a Clone Officer are violently flung out of the open doors Ð \\n\\nANAKIN: PADME!!!!\\n\\nHe stares down in horror as Padme hits the ground below and tumbles down the dune. \\n\\nANAKIN: PUT THE SHIP DOWN!! DOWN!!!!!\\nOBI-WAN: Anakin, donÕt let your personal feelings get in the way! (to the pilot) Follow that speeder!!\\n\\nThe Gunship continues itsÕ pursuit of DookuÕs speeder, followed by the two Beakwing fighters. \\n\\nANAKIN: LOWER THE SHIP!!\\nOBI-WAN: I CANÕT TAKE DOOKU ALONE!!! I NEED YOU!!! IF WE CATCH HIM, WE CAN END THIS WAR RIGHT NOW!! WE HAVE A JOB TO DO!!!\\nANAKIN: I DONÕT CARE!!

What do you think Padme would do if she were in your position? \\n\\nThat question stops Anakin up short. He sighs and lowers his head. \\n\\nANAKIN: She would do her duty.  \\n\\nEXT. COMMAND CENTER Ð DAY\\n\\nYoda stands next to the Clone Commander. He senses something is wrong with Padme. \\n\\nYODA: HmmmÉ\\nCLONE COMMANDER: The droid army is in full retreat. \\nYODA: Well done, Commander. Bring me a ship. \\n\\nEXT. GEONOSIS LANDSCAPE Ð DAY\\n\\nCount DookuÕs speeder bike shoots into the open door of a tower; the Gunship pauses next to it to long enough for Obi-Wan and Anakin leap down and run inside the tower. As the Gunship rises back into the air, it is destroyed by the two Beakwings. \\n\\nINT. GEONOSIS SECRET HANGAR TOWER Ð LATE DAY\\n\\nCount Dooku throws switches on a control panel. His Interstellar Sail Ship is parked nearby. The two Jedi rush into the hangar, lightsabers ignited and ready. Dooku smiles at the two with amusement. \\n\\nANAKIN: YouÕre going to pay for all of the Jedi that you killed today, Dooku.\\nOBI-WAN: WeÕll take him together. You slowly on the --\\nANAKIN: No, IÕm taking him NOW!!!\\n\\nWithout listening or thinking, an enraged Anakin charges at Dooku. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: NO ANAKIN, NO!!!\\n\\nBut just as the young apprentice is about to strike his first blow, Dooku calmly lifts his arm and shoots purple lightning out at the young man. Anakin is lifted up and flung across the room, slamming hard into the opposite wall. He slumps to the foot of the wall, barely conscious. Obi-Wan regards Dooku in horror. \\n\\nCOUNT DOOKU: Kenobi, is it? As you can see, my Jedi powers are far beyond yours. Now back down. \\n\\nDooku fires another volley of lightning from his fingertips; Obi-Wan intercepts it with his lightsaber. The electricity ripples around the blue blade and fades into nothingness. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: I donÕt think so. \\n\\nObi-Wan raises his lightsaber, ready for battle.\\n\\nCOUNT DOOKU: Ah, but if I mustÉ\\n\\nDooku pulls out a curved lightsaber handle, and a scarlet blade shoots out of it. He raises it to his face in salute and moves into a fencerÕs en garde stance. \\n\\nCOUNT DOOKU: I have spent the last ten years learning to use the power of the Dark Side. It gives me infinitely more power.\\nOBI-WAN: Prove it. \\n\\nObi-Wan charges at Dooku, lightsaber twirling. The two clash blades in a furious exchange of swings. Dooku handles his lightsaber much like a master fencer with his foil. Using calculated moves and expending little energy, Dooku easily blocks Obi-WanÕs wide, sweeping strikes. \\n\\nCOUNT DOOKU: Master Kenobi, you disappoint me. Yoda holds you in such high esteem. \\n\\nHe parries another blow from Obi-Wan.\\n\\nCOUNT DOOKU: Surely you can do better? \\n\\nAnother parry. \\n\\nCOUNT DOOKU: No, you canÕt. I\\'m surprised. Has Jedi swordsmanship degenerated so quickly, or are you trying to make fun of me? Which is it?\\n\\nDooku thrusts. Obi-Wan jumps back, gasping for breath. \\n\\nCOUNT DOOKU: (mocking) Come come, Master Kenobi. Put me out of my misery. \\n\\nObi-Wan takes a deep breath, gets a fresh grip on his lightsaber, and comes in again. For a moment, he drives Count Dooku back. Then DookuÕs superior skill begins to tell again, and he forces Obi-Wan to retreat. At the wall, Anakin groans and writhes in pain. \\n\\nEXT. GEONOSIS DUNES Ð LATE DAY\\n\\nOn the ground, Padme groans as well. A Clone Trooper rushes up and approaches her. \\n\\nCLONE TROOPER: Are you all right? \\n\\nPadme slowly regains her feet.\\n\\nPADME: YesÉI think so. \\nCLONE TROOPER: WeÕd better get back to the forward Command Center. \\nPADME: No, no. Gather what troops you can. WeÕve got to get to that hangar! Get a transport! HURRY!!\\nCLONE TROOPER: Right away!!\\n\\nThe two run toward the distant battlefield.\\n\\nINT. GEONOSIS SECRET HANGAR TOWER Ð LATE DAY\\n\\nDooku increases the tempo of his attack. Obi-Wan is pushed to the limit to defend himself. Dooku presses. Obi-Wan makes a lunging slash, and a laughing Dooku catches it. The two struggle in a test of strength, the two energy blades straining against each other. Dooku wins the test and runs his blade through Obi-WanÕs shoulder. The younger Jedi screams in agony and drops his blade. Dooku then slices Obi-WanÕs leg for good measure. Obi-Wan stumbles back against the wall, trips, and crashes to the ground. His lightsaber goes skittering across the floor. \\n\\nCOUNT DOOKU: And so it endsÉ\\n\\nWith a shrug, he raises his blade for the final blow as Obi-Wan stares at him helplessly Ð \\n\\n-- and AnakinÕs blade blocks it in mid-swing!!\\n\\nDooku is shocked and takes a step back. He regards Anakin with incredulity. \\n\\nCOUNT DOOKU: Brave of you, boy Ð but I thought youÕd learned your lesson.\\nANAKIN: (sneers) I am a slow learner. \\n\\nAnakin begins a flurry of attacks on Dooku. The fury of his attack catches Dooku off-guard, and he staggers back. Anakin swings and nicks him, and Dooku gasps and clutches the side of his arm. He pulls his hand away and stares at his blood, then looks at Anakin with a new respect. \\n\\nCOUNT DOOKU: You have unusual powers, my young Padawan. But not enough to save you this time. \\nANAKIN: DonÕt bet on it! \\nOBI-WAN: ANAKIN!! \\n\\nObi-Wan uses the Force to fling his lightsaber at Anakin. He catches it. Anakin skillfully wields the two lightsabers with relative ease. Dooku parries and ripostes. ItÕs no contest. Dooku knocks Obi-WanÕs green lightsaber from Anakin\\'s hand and relentless drives Anakin back. Anakin retreats, slicing a power cable on the floor. The hangar is cast into darkness, except for the blue and scarlet lights of the lightsaber blades. Another fierce, lightning-fast clash of blades. With a roar, Anakin thrusts forward -- and Dooku cuts AnakinÕs sword arm off at the elbow. \\n\\nBefore he even has the chance to scream, Dooku throws out his hand and Anakin is Force-shoved across the room. He falls and skids to a halt beside Obi-WanÕs body, driven unconscious by the shock and pain. Dooku sighs and extinguishes his lightsaber, suddenly seeming much older. He looks up and turns at a tapping noise at the hangar doorÉ\\n\\nSlowly, through the thick smoke, the tiny figure of Yoda hobbles into view. He stops on the smoke-filled threshold.\\n\\nYODA: Count Dooku. \\nCOUNT DOOKU: Master Yoda. \\n\\nDooku steps away from Obi-Wan and Anakin. For the first time, a hint of fear enters DookuÕs eyes. \\n\\nCOUNT DOOKU: You have interfered in our affairs for the last time. Now we shall see who is the most powerful.  \\n\\nDooku levitates machinery in the room and hurtles it at the tiny figure of the Jedi Master. Yoda effortlessly deflects the machinery and strikes a martial arts pose.\\n\\nDooku then causes great boulders in the ceiling above Yoda to fall. Again, Yoda deflects the boulders, which fall around him. \\n\\nYODA: Powerful you have become, Dooku. The Dark Side I sense in you. \\nCOUNT DOOKU: IÕve become more powerful than any Jedi. Even you.  \\n\\nDooku thrusts out his arm, flinging out purple Force lightning. Yoda catches the lightning in his hand Ð balls it up Ð and hurtles it right back at him!! Dooku deflects it into the wall, but just barely. He shoots more lightning out. Yoda again catches it in his hand, and it absorbs into his palm. \\n\\nYODA: Much to learn you still have. \\nCOUNT DOOKU: It is obvious this contest cannot be decided by our knowledge of the ForceÉ\\n\\nDooku reignites his lightsaber. \\n\\nCOUNT DOOKU: Ébut by our skills with a lightsaber. \\nYODA: No interest in contests do I have. \\n\\nDooku whirls his lightsaber in a formal salute. Yoda Force-pulls his lightsaber out from under his robe and ignites it. \\n \\nYoda attacks! He flies forward with a screeching yell. Dooku is forced to retreat. Words are insufficient to describe the range and skill of YodaÕs speed and swordplay. The little gnomeÕs lightsaber is a blur of emerald-green light, too fast for Dooku to defend against. He smoothly blocks DookuÕs blows and spins through the air like a tiny tornado, bouncing off the Sail Ship and the hangar wall. Finally, their blades cross and the fighting slows. Yoda inches closer and quietly speaksÉ\\n\\nYODA: Fought well you have, my old Padawan. But the end for you this is. \\nCOUNT DOOKU: The battle is far from over. This is just the beginning -- \\n\\nMustering all the strength he can find, Dooku suddenly dislodges Yoda and, using the Force, brings one of the huge hanging ceiling cranes in the hangar crashing down on Obi-Wan and Anakin. In the blink of an eye, Yoda closes his eyes and concentrates. The fallen crane trembles and starts to lift. Count Dooku runs up the shipÕs ramp, throwing a last look back before going inside. \\n\\nObi-Wan is still awake and tries to add what little strength he has left into helping his old master. Yoda concentrates harder. Slowly, with their combined power, the crane rises. Yoda exerts every ounce of his powers. The crane lifts clear of Obi-Wan and Anakin and is thrown to the ground.\\n\\nThe Sail ShipÕs ramp closes, and the sound of the ship\\'s engines are heard starting up.\\n\\nEXT. GEONOSIS LANDSCAPE Ð LATE DAY\\n\\nAnother Gunship floats beside the open door of the hangar. Padme and several Clone Troopers race out of it. In the hangar, the sound of the engines increases. DookuÕs Sailor Ship takes off through a hangar portal. Padme and the Clone Troopers shoot at it, but it is too late. The Sailor Ship rises into the air and flies away into the sunset sky.\\n\\nEXT. GEONOSIS -- SPACE \\n\\nPassing one of the rising Trade Federation battleships, the solar sails unfurl on DookuÕs ship. It blurs away into hyperspace. \\n\\nINT. GEONOSIS SECRET HANGAR TOWER Ð LATE DAY\\n\\nAnakin slowly awakens, bathed in sweat and moaning in agony. Yoda sighs heavily at the sad sight and summons his gimer stick back into his hand, sagging onto it with all the weight of his advanced years. Obi-Wan slowly pulls himself up, hobbling on his injured leg. \\n\\nPADME: (O.S.) ANAKIN!!\\n\\nPadme and the Clone Troopers rush in. The very sight of Padme reinvigorates Anakin, and he pulls himself up as well. Padme runs up to Anakin and throws her arms around him. Anakin is so tired and exhausted that he can barely stand. The clone captain approaches Yoda. \\n                                                           \\nCLONE CAPTAIN: Resistance is at an end, General. Awaiting your orders. \\n\\nYoda sighs again. \\n\\nYODA: A dark day it isÉ\\n\\nWIPE TO:  \\n\\nEXT. SPACE Ð CORUSCANT\\n\\nCount DookuÕs Interstellar Sail Ship emerges from hyperspace and floats toward the glittering world of Coruscant. The golden solar sails fold up and move back into the tiny vessel. \\n\\nEXT. CORUSCANT, OLD TOWN Ð DAWN\\n\\nThe Sail Ship glides through a deserted, burned-out part of Coruscant. Count Dooku maneuvers his ship into one of the empty buildings and lands. \\n\\nINT. CORUSCANT, SECRET LANDING PLATFORM Ð DAWN\\n\\nThe ramp lowers. Count Dooku walks down the ramp and into the abandoned hangar, where he is then greeted by the hooded figure of Darth Sidious. Dooku bows. \\n\\nCOUNT DOOKU: The Force is with us, Master Sidious.                                                            \\nDARTH SIDIOUS: Welcome home, Lord Tyranus. You have done well.  \\nCOUNT DOOKU: I bring good news for you, my Lord. War has begun. \\nDARTH SIDIOUS: Excellent. Everything is going as planned. \\n\\nOnly a triumphant smile is seen from beneath the black hood. \\n\\nEXT. CORUSCANT Ð JEDI TEMPLE Ð SUNSET\\n\\nThe beautiful temple basks in the red glow of the setting sun. \\n\\nINT. JEDI TEMPLE, JEDI COUNCIL CHAMBER -- SUNSET\\n\\nObi-Wan and Mace Windu stand and look out through the tall windows of the Council Chamber at the great plaza below. Yoda sits in his chair. \\n\\nOBI-WAN: Do you believe what Count Dooku said about Sidious controlling the Senate? It doesnÕt feel rightÉ\\nYODA: Joined the Dark Side Dooku has. LiesÉdeceitÉcreating mistrust are his ways now. \\nMACE WINDU: Nevertheless, I feel we should keep a closer eye on the Senate. \\nYODA: I agree. \\nMACE WINDU: Where is your apprentice? \\nOBI-WAN: On his way to Naboo, escorting Senator Amidala. (beat, then an attempt at cheer) I have to admit that without the clones, it would not have been a victory. \\n\\nFrom his seat, a sad Yoda scowls at Obi-Wan. He is the only other person in the room Ð all the other Council chairs are chillingly empty. \\n\\nYODA: Victory?!? ÔVictoryÕ, you say? Master Obi-WanÉ (shakes his head) not a victory. A defeat it was. The shroud of the Dark Side has fallen. Begun, the Clone War hasÉ\\n\\nEXT. CORUSCANT, MILITARY STAGING ARENA, BALCONY -- SUNSET\\n\\nChancellor Palpatine, Bail Organa, Mas Amedda, Jar Jar Binks, and the other members of the Loyalist Committee stand on a balcony and, with deeply sad expressions on their faces, oversee a dreadful site to behold in the square belowÉ \\n\\nBeneath them prevails a military staging arena where tens of thousands of Clone Troopers are drawn up in strict formation or move forward in neat files to climb the ramps of Military Assault Ships. In the background, loaded Assault Ships rise into the air, and others land immediately to take their place. The sky beyond is thick with rising and falling transports. Clone troops march and board the ships. Bail pounds his fist against the balcony railing in frustration; PalpatineÕs face is carefully neutral. \\n\\nThe Clone Wars have begun. \\n\\nEXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, GARDEN Ð LATE DAY\\n\\nIn a rose-covered arbor overlooking the sparkling lake, Anakin and Padme stand before a Naboo holy man. Anakin now has a robotic, skeletal looking arm grafted to his elbow.\\n\\nThe two trusty droids, C-3PO and R2-D2, are the only members in attendance during this eminent occasion. Artoo has been polished up; Threepio is still in his beat-up tin plating.  \\n\\nAnakin takes PadmeÕs hand with his remaining one; Padme slowly does the same with his robot hand. The holy man turns and leaves. As rose petals fall all around them, they move in close and kiss.  \\n\\nThreepio rests his hand on ArtooÕs dome. Anakin and Padme slowly break the kiss and look outward, towards the horizon, towards the setting sunÉ\\n\\nIRIS OUT.\\n\\nEND CREDITS PLAY OVER A STARFIELD. \\n\\nFADE OUT.\\n\\n\\n\\nDirected by.......................................ÉÉÉÉ......GEORGE LUCAS\\nScreenplay ByÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉ.GEORGE LUCAS, JONATHAN HALES\\nStory ByÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉGEORGE LUCAS\\nProduced by..........................................................RICK McCALLUM\\nExecutive Producer..............................................GEORGE LUCAS\\nDirector of Photography.............................ÉÉ..DAVID TATTERSALL, B.S.C.\\nProduction Designer..............................................GAVIN BOCQUET\\nEditor and Sound DesignerÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉBEN BURTT\\nCostume Designer.................................................TRISHA BIGGAR\\nCasting by.....................................................ÉÉ..ROBIN GURLAND\\nMusic by......................................................ÉÉÉ.JOHN WILLIAMS\\n\\nStarring\\n\\nEWAN MCGREGOR\\n\\nNATALIE PORTMAN\\n\\nHAYDEN CHRISTENSEN\\n\\nAND FRANK OZ AS YODA\\n\\nCo-Starring\\n\\nIAN MCDIARMID\\n\\nPERNILLA AUGUST\\n\\nAHMED BEST\\n\\nOLIVER FORD DAVIES\\n\\nTEMUERA MORRISON\\n\\nANTHONY DANIELS\\n\\nSILAS CARSON\\n\\nKENNY BAKER\\n\\nWith SAMUEL L.

SPACE\\n\\nA long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.\\n\\nA vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the Main Title, followed by a rollup, which crawls into infinity.\\n\\nWar! The Republic is crumbling under attacks by the ruthless Sith Lord, Count Dooku. There are heroes on both sides. Evil is everywhere.\\n\\nIn a stunning move, the fiendish droid leader, General Grievous, has swept into the Republic capital and kidnapped Chancellor Palpatine, leader of the Galactic Senate.\\n\\nAs the Separatist Droid Army attempts to flee the besieged capital with their valuable hostage, two Jedi Knights lead a desperate mission to rescue the captive Chancellor. . . .\\n\\nPAN DOWN to reveal a REPUBLIC ATTACK CRUISER. Continue to PAN with the Cruiser as TWO JEDI STARFIGHTERS enter and head toward an enemy Battle Cruiser. TRUCK with the Jedi Fighters as they maneuver in unison, dodging flack and enemy laser fire. R2-D2 is on Anakin\\'s ship. R4-P17 is on Obi-Wan\\'s ship. A giant space battle is revealed as the tiny Jedi ships continue their assault in a synchronous ballet.\\n\\n2 INT. OBI-WAN\\'S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE\\n\\nOBI-WAN bounces through the flack with a frown. His ship rocks violently.\\n\\n3 INT. ANAKINS STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE\\n\\nANAKIN smiles as he blasts a TRADE FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTER.\\n\\nANAKIN: There isn\\'t a droid made that can out fly you, Master, and no other way to get to the Chancellor . . .\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Look out, four droids inbound . . .\\n\\n4 EXT. CORUSCANT-SPACE BATTLE\\n\\nThe TWO JEDI FIGHTERS swerve in unison as FOUR TRADE FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTERS attack. After several clever moves by the Jedi, two of the FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTERS collide with each other in a ball of flame.\\n\\n5 INT. OBI-WAN\\'S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE\\n\\nOBI-WAN struggles to maintain control of his ship.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: We\\'ve got to split them up.\\n\\nANAKIN: Break left, fly through the guns on that tower.\\n\\nOBI-WAN flies to the left of a huge tower on a REPUBLIC CRUISER. The TWO DROID DROP FIGHTERS follow.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Easy for you to say . . . why am I always the bait?\\n\\nANAKIN: Don\\'t worry. I\\'m coming around behind you.\\n\\nOBI-WAN deftly maneuvers around a large Starship\\'s superstructure, but the TWO DROID FIGHTERS stay on his tail, BLASTING him with intense laser fire.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Anakin, they\\'re all over me!\\n\\nANAKIN: Dead ahead! Closing . . . lock onto him, Artoo . . .\\n\\nARTOO BEEPS his reply as ANAKIN swoops in for the kill. ANAKIN BLASTS one of the DROID DROP FIGHTERS. It EXPLODES.\\n\\nANAKIN: (continuing, laughs) We got him, Artoo!\\n\\nANAKIN BLASTS away at the second DROID DROP FIGHTER as ARTOO BEEPS an angry warning.\\n\\nANAKIN: I copy, Artoo.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I\\'m going down on the deck.\\n\\nANAKIN: Good idea ... I need some room to maneuver.\\n\\nOBI-WAN dives toward the surface of one of the larger TRADE FEDERATION BATTLESHIPS and is forced to fly through a maelstrom of laser flack. He skims the surface, followed by the DROID DROP FIGHTER, which is followed by ANAKIN.\\n\\nANAKIN: (continuing) Cut right. Do you hear me?! Cut right. Don\\'t let him get a handle on you. Come on, Artoo, lock on! Lock on!\\n\\nARTOO BEEPS. The crosshairs merge on the DROID DROP FIGHTER.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Hurry up! I don\\'t like this!\\n\\nOBI-WAN flies through a narrow gap between two towers on a Battleship. The DROID DROP FIGHTER hits one of Obi-Wan\\'s wings with a laser blast, and parts of the ship go flying around Obi-Wan\\'s Astro Droid, ARFOUR.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) Ouch!\\n\\nR-4 BEEPS a blue streak.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) Don\\'t even try to fix it, Arfour. I\\'ve shut it down.\\n\\nANAKIN: We\\'re locked on ... we\\'ve got him . . .\\n\\nANAKIN drops in behind the DROID DROP FIGHTER and blows him apart. ARTOO SQUEALS with delight.\\n\\nANAKIN: (continuing) Yeah! We got him . . . good going, Artoo.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Next time you\\'re the bait . . . Now let\\'s find the Command Ship and get on with it ...\\n\\nR-4 BEEPS a blue streak.\\n\\nANAKIN: Lock onto them, Artoo. Master, General Grievous\\'s ship is directly ahead.\\n\\nARTOO BEEPS a reply, and it reads out in Anakin\\'s cockpit.\\n\\nANAKIN: (continuing) The one crawling with vulture droids.\\n\\n6 INT. OBI-WAN\\'S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I see it. Oh, this is going to be easy.\\n\\nAhead is a TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER with batlike DROID VULTURE FIGHTERS stalking around on the hull. The VULTURE FIGHTERS transform into flight configuration, lift off the CRUISER, and attack the JEDI STARFIGHTERS.\\n\\nANAKIN: Come on, Master.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Not this time. There\\'s too much at stake. We need help. Odd Ball, do you copy?\\n\\nODD BALL: (OS) Copy, Red Leader.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Mark my position and form your squad up behind me . . .\\n\\n7 INT. ODD BALL\\'S FIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE\\n\\nODD BALL: We\\'re on your tail, General Kenobi. Set S-foils in attack position.\\n\\nThe protective ray shield lowers on the main hangar of the TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER, and six new DROID TRI-FIGHTERS emerge and join the DROID VULTURE FIGHTERS heading toward the Jedi. The JEDI STARFIGHTERS extend the stability foils on the ends of their wings.\\n\\n8 INT. ANAKIN\\'S FIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE\\n\\nANAKIN: This is where the fun begins. Ten Vulture Droids straight ahead, coming down the left side.\\n\\nARTOO BEEPS a worried message.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Add five Tri-fighters on the right . . .\\n\\nANAKIN: I\\'m going head to head. See you.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Take it easy, Anakin.\\n\\nFour Clone Fighters move into formation behind the Jedi.\\n\\nODD BALL: I\\'m on your right, Red Leader.\\n\\nANAKIN: Incoming!!\\n\\nARTOO SQUEALS as five DROID TRI-FIGHTERS pass by at high speed on the right.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Five more on the right!\\n\\nFour more VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS pass at high speed from the left. All hell breaks loose. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN continue to fly in unison, backing up each other. ARTOO SQUEALS.\\n\\nANAKIN: Here we go.\\n\\nThe Jedi ships split up and make a quick loop around the DROID TRI-FIGHTERS, ending up behind them. BLASTING away. The DROID TRI-FIGHTERS EXPLODE.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I\\'m going high and right.\\n\\nANAKIN: Hang on. There are four more of them.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Stay with me . . . swing back and right . . . help me engage. Back off ... Let them pass between us.\\n\\nANAKIN: I\\'m coming around. I\\'m coming around on your tail.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: All right, engage . . . and hurry. These droids are all over me like a rash.\\n\\nIn one incredible move, ANAKIN swings in behind the DROID TRI-FIGHTERS, blowing them away one by one until there is only one left. ARTOO CHIRPS.\\n\\nARTOO lets out a HOWL as ANAKIN accelerates past the last DROID TRI-FIGHTER, slams on his brakes, flips the Fighter around, and BLASTS the Fighter from the front. ARTOO BEEPS frantically as they fly through the debris of the destroyed ships. ANAKIN looks behind him.\\n\\nANAKIN: How many back there. Artoo? (Artoo beeps) Three . . . (continuing) Four . . . that\\'s not good.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Anakin, you have four on your tail.\\n\\nANAKIN: I know. I know!\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Four more closing from your left.\\n\\nANAKIN: I know. I know!\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Break right and go high.\\n\\nANAKIN: I\\'m going low and left.\\n\\nObi-Wan shakes his head.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: (to himself) He still has much to learn.\\n\\nANAKIN swoops low and skims across a TRADE FEDERATION BATTLESHIP, dodging flack as ARTOO bounces along, trying to get out a sentence.\\n\\nANAKIN: Hang on, Artoo. Obi-Wan, do you copy? I\\'m going to pull them through the needle . . .\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Too dangerous. First Jedi rule: \"Survive.\"\\n\\nANAKIN: Sorry, no choice. Come down here and thin them out a little.\\n\\nOBI-WAN drops in behind the DROID VULTURE FIGHTERS chasing Anakin. ARFOUR BEEPS to OBI-WAN.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Just keep me steady . . . hold on ... not yet. . . now break left.\\n\\nOBI-WAN fires as he swings across the back of the VULTURE DROIDS, BLASTING four of them away. ANAKIN heads for a trench along the surface of one of the Trade Federation Battleships. He flies into the trench, which ends in a conning tower with a small slit between two main struts.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) You\\'ll never get through there, Anakin. It\\'s too tight.\\n\\nARTOO BEEPS nervously.\\n\\nANAKIN: Easy, Artoo . . . we\\'ve done this before.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Use the Force, think yourself through, the ship will follow.\\n\\nARTOO SQUEALS in a panic. On the view screen Artoo\\'s squeal reads out, \"WE\\'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT.\"\\n\\nANAKIN: Wrong thought, Artoo.\\n\\nANAKIN slips through the narrow gap. The trailing VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS CRASH.\\n\\nANAKIN: (continuing) I\\'m through.\\n\\nOBI-WAN continues to fire on the VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS, driving them into the EXPLOSION.\\nA CLONE fighter is hit and explodes, spewing debris. The CLONE PILOT spins off into space.\\nFinally, OBI-WAN peels off and swings around, pulling up alongside ANAKIN. CLONE FIGHT SQUAD SEVEN battles the DROIDS.\\n\\nODD BALL: There are too many of them.\\n\\nCLONE PILOT 2: I\\'m on your wing. Break left. Break left. They\\'re all over me. Get them off my . . .\\n\\nANAKIN: I\\'m going to go help them out!\\n\\nOBI-WAN: No, no! They are doing their job so we can do ours. Head for the Command Ship!\\n\\nAnother CLONE fighter is hit, bursts into flames, and spins off into space. A VULTURE DROID FIGHTER raises its head to locate its target and fires missiles at them.\\n\\nANAKIN: Missiles! Pull up!\\n\\nANAKIN and OBI-WAN break right and left, and the missiles follow them. ANAKIN does a barrel roll spin, causing the missiles following him to collide and EXPLODE. Two missiles continue to chase OBI-WAN. He banks sharply to the right, then to the left, causing one of the missiles to overshoot.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: They overshot us . . .\\n\\nThe second missile streaks next to Obi-Wan s Fighter and EXPLODES. Obi-Wan\\'s ship rocks, and R-4, SCREAMS as the Starfighter rips through the explosion. Debris flies all around them.\\n\\nANAKIN: They\\'re coming around!\\n\\nOBI-WAN: All right, Arfour. No, no. Nothing too fancy.\\n\\nANAKIN: Surge all power units. Artoo! Stand by the reverse thrusters.\\n\\nANAKIN spins his starfighter. The missiles spin and collide.\\n\\nANAKIN: We got \\'em. Artoo!\\n\\nTwo missiles continue to track Obi-Wan.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Flying is for droids.\\n\\nSuddenly, OBI-WAN shudders, and his ship starts to plummet toward the surface of the Trade Federation Cruiser. The trailing missiles fly into what looks like debris, and detonate. Five silver balls fly out of the debris and attach themselves to the ship. The balls pop open, revealing SMALL BUZZDROIDS that begin to crawl across the surface like spiders.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) I\\'m hit! Anakin?\\n\\nANAKIN: I see them . . . Buzz Droids.\\n\\nThe BUZZ DROIDS crawl across Obi-Wan\\'s ship and start to tear it apart. SPARKS ERUPT where the BUZZ DROIDS break into the wiring. One of the BUZZ DROIDS goes after ARFOUR.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Arfour, be careful. You have one . . .\\n\\nARFOUR\\'s head gets ripped off and flies away.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Oh dear. They\\'re shutting down all the controls.\\n\\nANAKIN: Move to the right so I can get a clear shot at them.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: The mission. Get to the Command Ship. Get the Chancellor! I\\'m running out of tricks here.\\n\\nANAKIN moves into position just off Obi-Wan\\'s left side and angles his ship so his guns are pointing at the DROIDS crawling over Obi-Wan s Starfighter. ANAKIN fires and vaporizes the TWO BUZZ DROIDS, along with the left wing of Obi-Wan\\'s ship.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) In the name of ...\\n\\nANAKIN: Steady . . . steady . . .\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Anakin, hold your fire . . . hold your fire. You\\'re not helping here.\\n\\nANAKIN: I agree, bad idea. Swing right . . . ease over . . . steady . . .\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Wait . . . wait . . . I can\\'t see a thing! My cockpit\\'s fogging. They\\'re all over me, Anakin.\\n\\nANAKIN: Move to the right.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Hold on, Anakin. You\\'re going to get us both killed! Get out of here. There\\'s nothing more you can do.\\n\\nANAKIN: I\\'m not leaving without you, Master.\\n\\nANAKIN moves his ship next to OBI-WAN\\'s and tries to physically knock the BUZZ DROIDS off. There are five left. He manages to get one off, but badly dents OBI-WAN\\'s ship in the process. One of the BUZZ DROIDS tears apiece off of the front of Obi-Wan\\'s ship. Flames burst out, and more smoke billows out, obscuring the Jedi\\'s view.\\n\\nANAKIN knocks off three of the BUZZ DROIDS and the fourth crawls out onto Anakin\\'s ship and starts attacking ARTOO. ARTOO fights the BUZZ DROID.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Blast it ... I can\\'t see . . . my controls are gone.\\n\\nANAKIN: Get \\'em, Artoo. Watch out!\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Artoo, hit the buzz droid\\'s center eye.\\n\\nARTOO extends an arm and aims a stream of electricity at the swerving BUZZ DROID. The BUZZ DROID is hit squarely in the eye and falls off the ship.\\n\\nANAKIN: Yeah, you got him!\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Great, Artoo.\\n\\nANAKIN: Stay on my wing . . . the General\\'s Command Ship is dead ahead. Easy . . . pull up ... Head for the hangar.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Have you noticed the shields are still up?\\n\\nANAKIN: Oh?!? Sorry, Master.\\n\\nANAKIN streaks ahead of OBI-WAN\\'s disintegrating Jedi Fighter and blasts the shield generator. It SPARKS and EXPLODES.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Oh, I have a bad feeling about this.\\n\\n9 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nThe shield door drops away, and OBI-WAN crashes on the deck of the hangar bay, engulfed in a FANTAIL OF SPARKS. A set of blast doors starts SLAMMING shut across the hangar opening, as material is sucked into space.\\n\\nANAKIN maneuvers around the oncoming junk and flies into the hangar just as the blast doors SLAM shut.\\nOBI-WAN ignites his light saber and cuts his way out of the cockpit. He jumps dear just as his ship EXPLODES. BATTLE DROIDS rush at him from all directions.\\n\\nANAKIN jumps out of his ship and cuts his way through the BATTLE DROIDS to where OBI-WAN is fighting. ARTOO pops out of the ship and follows ANAKIN.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Artoo, locate the Chancellor.\\n\\nANAKIN: Tap into the ship\\'s computers.\\n\\nThey cut down the last of the droids and follow ARTOO over to a computer wall socket. The two JEDI fight off FOUR MORE DROIDS as ARTOO tries to find the Chancellor. Finally, a HOLOGRAM of the Trade Federation ship appears.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: The Chancellor\\'s signal is coming from right there. The observation platform at the top of that spire.\\n\\nANAKIN: I sense Count Dooku . . .\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I sense a trap.\\n\\nANAKIN: Next move?\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Spring the trap.\\n\\nThe JEDI start to leave; ARTOO follows. The JEDI stop and turn to ARTOO.\\n\\nANAKIN: Artoo, go back. I need you to stay with the ship.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Here, take this, and wait for orders.\\n\\nOBI-WAN tosses the comlink to ARTOO.\\n\\n10 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS enters the bridge of the TRADE FEDERATION cruiser followed by his TWO BODYGUARDS. He walks to the front of the bridge and stands in front of the NEIMOIDIAN CAPTAIN.\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: What\\'s the situation, Captain?\\n\\nCAPTAIN: TWO Jedi have landed in the main hangar bay.\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Just as Count Dooku predicted.\\n\\n11 INT. HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nANAKIN and OBI-WAN head for the elevator. A door opens in the hallway and two of GENERAL GRIEVOUS\\'s BODYGUARDS confront the JEDI.\\n\\nBODYGUARD I: General Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker. We\\'ve been waiting for you.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: We are here to relieve you of Chancellor Palpatine, not join him.\\n\\nAs a dozen more droids join the group, the JEDI ignite their lightsabers and stand back-to-back.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Anakin. . .\\n\\nANAKIN: Ready.\\n\\nANAKIN and OBI-WAN use their lightsabers and cut a large circle in the floor.\\n\\n12 INT. GENERATOR ROOM-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nThe TWO JEDI cut their way down several floors into a large generator room. Huge EXPLOSIONS outside the ship have caused several large pipes overhead to break, and fluid is spewing everywhere. The Jedi get up and turn off their light sabers. ANAKIN dips his hand into the fluid and sniffs it.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: . . . fuel. The slightest charge from our sabers will send this ship into oblivion. That\\'s why they\\'ve stopped shooting.\\n\\nANAKIN: Well then, we\\'re safe for the time being.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Your idea of safe is not the same as mine.\\n\\nThey run, EXPLOSIONS rattle the ship, and pipes continue to burst around them, spilling more fuel into the hallway. At the far end, SIX SUPER BATTLE DROIDS drop into the fuel. The SOUNDS OF SHIELD DOORS CLOSING AND LOCKING ECHO throughout the hallway. They pass several large power generators, which are topped with SPARKING excess power dischargers.\\n\\nANAKIN: They\\'re sealing this section off.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Six droids coming our way!\\n\\nThe last of the DOORS CAN BE HEARD CLOSING in the distance.\\n\\nANAKIN: Keep moving. There must be vents . . . This way.\\n\\nThey move along a wall. ANAKIN climbs up the side to a small vent. The fuel gets closer to the SPARKING dischargers.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: We\\'ll never get through that. It\\'s too small!\\n\\nThey move toward a second vent. OBI-WAN is swimming in the fuel as it reaches to within a couple yards of the ceiling. ANAKIN feels along the ceiling and finds another smaller vent. He closes his eyes and tries to sense an opening, then he moves on. OBI-WAN is forced into hand-to-hand combat with one of the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. It pulls the Jedi under the fuel. Just before he is about to drown, OBI-WAN disables the SUPER BATTLE DROID by pushing him into an exhaust pipe.\\n\\nThe fuel is up to the Jedi\\'s chins. ANAKIN finds a very, very small metal grate, then pounds on it until the tiny grate breaks loose.\\n\\nANAKIN: I found our escape vent.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Anakin, this is no time for jokes. We\\'re in serious trouble here.\\n\\nANAKIN: Only in your mind. My Master. Look, no structure. . . .\\n\\nANAKIN grabs the side of the tiny hole and gives it a big yank, ripping a large panel loose revealing a \"man-sized\" work shaft. They scramble through it as the DROIDS swim closer.\\n\\n13 INT. VENT SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nThe TWO JEDI pull themselves through the narrow vent shaft until they reach a small hatch in the side of the tube.\\n\\nANAKIN: Here\\'s a way out.\\n\\nAs the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS reach the opening in the ceiling and the fuel gets to within a few feet of the power generator sparks, the JEDI work the keyboard on the pressure lock, opening the latch.\\n\\n14 INT. SMALL PASSAGEWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nThe TWO JEDI climb into a small passageway and slam the hatch shut. They make their way through the ever-shrinking shaft until they reach the end.\\n\\n15 INT. HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nA hatch opens in one of the main hallways of the Trade Federation Cruiser, and the JEDI squeeze out, SLAMMING the hatch. Behind them, ANAKIN seals the hatch with his laser sword.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: That won\\'t hold when the fuel hits those power dischargers.\\n\\nANAKIN: The blast will break the hull. This side\\'s pressurized.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: You still have much to learn, Anakin.\\n\\n16 INT. VENT SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nThe SUPER BATTLE DROIDS climb up the vent shaft. SUPER BATTLE DROID R77 and SEVERAL OTHER DROIDS wait in the generator room as the fuel continues to rise toward the power discharger.\\n\\nSUPER BATTLE DROID R77: I have a bad feeling about this.\\n\\n17 INT. GENERATOR ROOM-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nThe fuel hits the SPARKING power discharger, and there is a HUGE EXPLOSION.\\n\\n18 EXT. TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER-BATTLE\\n\\nA GREAT EXPLOSION and a flaming gas cloud spray out of the side of the Federation Cruiser.\\n\\n19 INT. HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nA large bulge appears in the wall around the sealed hatch as the EXPLOSION hits. OBI-WAN jumps back, then stands amazed.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: All right, you win. I have much to learn. Let\\'s go!\\n\\nANAKIN grins at OBI-WAN, and they run down the hallway.\\n\\n20 INT. WIDE HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nThe two JEDI wait for an elevator to arrive. They turn around and see they are face to face with THREE DESTROYER DROIDS. The DROIDS start blasting away. Anakin deflects the bolts. OBI-WAN frantically pushes the elevator button several more times.\\n\\nANAKIN: Destroyers!!\\n\\nFinally the door opens, and they rush inside under a hail of laser bolts. The elevator door slides shut. The JEDI turn to see BATTLE DROIDS standing behind them.\\n\\nBATTLE DROID: Drop your weapons! I said drop \\'em.\\n\\nThe JEDI activate their light sabers and destroy all the BATTLE DROIDS.\\n\\n21 INT HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nR2-D2 notices two SUPER BATTLE DROIDS entering the hangar. He moves and hides behind a Jedi Starfighter.\\n\\n22 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nThe elevator begins to move and screeches to a stop.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Did you press the stop button?\\n\\nANAKIN: No, did you?\\n\\nOBI-WAN: No!\\n\\nANAKIN: Well, there\\'s more than one way out of here.\\n\\nANAKIN ignites his laser sword.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: We don\\'t want to get out, we want to get moving. Artoo . . . Artoo. Do you copy? Activate elevator . . . (looks at control panel) . . . 31174 . . .\\n\\nANAKIN cuts a hole in the elevator ceiling.\\n\\n23 INT MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nTWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS are inspecting the Jedi starfighters. They overhear Obi-Wan\\'s voice over the comlink and are distracted.\\n\\nSUPER BATTLE DROID 1: What\\'s that?\\n\\nSUPER BATTLE DROID 2: Get back to work. It\\'s nothing.\\n\\n24 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Artoo?\\n\\nANAKIN climbs through the hole in the ceiling of the elevator.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) Always on the move.\\n\\nOBI-WAN continues to talk on the comlink. Artoo quietly beeps a reply.\\n\\n25 INT MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nARTOO tries to muffle the comlink as the TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS try to figure out where the voices are coming from. ARTOO extends an arm and plugs into a computer interface.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: (OS) Artoo, switch on the comlink. Artoo, do you hear me? Artoo, we gave you a job to do! Artoo.\\n\\n26 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nSuddenly, the elevator plummets down the shaft. ANAKIN quickly jumps and grabs onto the hallway entry door. He watches as the elevator recedes down the shaft and disappears. ANAKIN struggles to keep his grip on the closed door as SPARKING wires rain down on him.\\n\\n27 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nThe elevator starts to descend rapidly.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Stop, stop! Artoo, we need to be going up.\\n\\n28 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nAnakin struggles to hang on to the narrow edge of the elevator shaft. The door to the elevator shaft is pried open, and TWO BATTLE DROIDS appear in the doorway and look down at ANAKIN. They point their guns at him.\\n\\nDROID 1: Hands up, Jedi! Don\\'t move.\\n\\nDROID 2: Roger, roger.\\n\\n29 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nThe TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS overhear OBI-WAN\\'s comlink messages to ARTOO.\\n\\nSUPER BATTLE DROID 1: There it is again.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: (OS) Artoo, do you copy? Artoo, do you hear me? Artoo, we need to be going up, not down.\\n\\n30 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nThe elevator races down as OBI-WAN holds on.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Stop. Artoo! We need to go up! Stop, stop!\\n\\nThe elevator stops with a jolt. OBI-WAN falls to the floor.\\n\\n31 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nThe TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS see ARTOO and walk toward the little droid.\\n\\nSUPER BATTLE DROID 1: Hey you!\\n\\nARTOO plugs into the interface again and the elevator shoots up.\\n\\n32 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nOBI-WAN stands up after having fallen in the elevator.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Now, that\\'s better . . .\\n\\n33 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nARTOO is held up by TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS, who chuckle as the little Astro Droid curses and swings at them.\\n\\nSUPER BATTLE DROID 1: You stupid little astro droid!\\n\\n34 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nANAKIN looks down and sees the elevator heading toward him at a high rate of speed. He looks at the BATTLE DROIDS leaning over him with their guns pointed at him. He calculates for a moment, then gives himself a push and flips himself up into the elevator shaft.\\n\\nBefore ANAKIN can arc into a descent down the shaft, the elevator races up through the shaft, cutting the DROIDS in two. ANAKIN lands on the elevator and quickly drops back through the hole in the ceiling. OBI-WAN is startled and ignites his lightsaber.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Oh, it\\'s you . . .\\n\\n35 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nARTOO activates his oil hose and sprays the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. The SUPER BATTLE DROIDS slip on the oil.\\n\\n36 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nANAKIN: What was that all about?\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Well, Artoo has been . . .\\n\\nANAKIN: No loose wire jokes . . . He\\'s doing the best he can.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Did I say anything?\\n\\nANAKIN: He\\'s trying!\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I didn\\'t say anything!\\n\\n37 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nARTOO ignites his arm rockets and shoots out of their grip, spraying them both with oil and setting them on fire. The SUPER BATTLE DROIDS slip and slide until they fall, smoldering. ARTOO rolls away.\\n\\n38 INT. GENERAL\\'S QUARTER\\'S-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nThe elevator door opens and the TWO JEDI carefully make their way into the main room of the General\\'s Quarters.\\nAt the far end sits SUPREME CHANCELLOR PALPATINE. ANAKIN and OBI-WAN move toward the CHANCELLOR.\\nAs they get closer to PALPATINE, they see a very distressed look on the Chancellor\\'s face.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: (bows) Chancellor.\\n\\nANAKIN: Are you all right?\\n\\nPALPATINE: (quietly) Count Dooku.\\n\\nPALPATINE makes a small gesture with his hand. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN turn around. The elevator DOORS CAN BE HEARD OPENING AND CLOSING as COUNT DOOKU strides into the room. He is above the Jedi, standing on a balcony, with two SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. The Jedi turn to see him. He looks down on the Jedi.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: (quietly to Anakin) This time we will do it together.\\n\\nANAKIN: I was about to say that.\\n\\nCOUNT DOOKU jumps down to the main level.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Get help! You\\'re no match for him. He\\'s a Sith Lord.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Chancellor Palpatine, Sith Lords are our specialty.\\n\\nOBI-WAN and ANAKIN throw off their cloaks and ignite their lightsabers.\\n\\nCOUNT DOOKU: Your swords, please, Master Jedi. We don\\'t want to make a mess of things in front of the Chancellor.\\n\\nOBI-WAN and ANAKIN move toward DOOKU.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: You won\\'t get away this time, Dooku.\\n\\nOBI-WAN and ANAKIN charge COUNT DOOKU. A great sword fight ensues.\\n\\nCOUNT DOOKU: I\\'ve been looking forward to this.\\n\\nANAKIN: My powers have doubled since the last time we met, Count.\\n\\nCOUNT DOOKU: Good. Twice the pride, double the fall.\\n\\nDOOKU lunges at the JEDI and they fall back . . .\\n\\nCOUNT DOOKU: (continuing) Your moves are clumsy, Kenobi . . . too predictable. You\\'ll have to do better.\\n\\nAs the battle proceeds, OBI-WAN and COUNT DOOKU are tired. ANAKIN is stronger as he becomes angry. ANAKIN continues to drive the attack on DOOKU. COUNT DOOKU throws OBI-WAN back using the Force.\\nANAKIN and COUNT DOOKU move up the stairs. As they reach the upper landing of the General\\'s Quarters, ANAKIN leaps over COUNT DOOKU. OBI-WAN reaches the top of the stairs, destroying TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. COUNT DOOKU holds OBI-WAN in the air using the Force as he turns and kicks ANAKIN out of frame. OBI-WAN is choking.\\nANAKIN hits the archway.\\nDOOKU sends OBI-WAN flying. The Jedi tumbles to the lower level unconscious. COUNT DOOKU spins around again and, using the Force, causes a section of the balcony to drop onto OBI-WAN. ANAKIN spins and kicks COUNT DOOKU, sending him over the balcony. ANAKIN Jumps, following him down to the main floor. COUNT DOOKU and ANAKIN continue the fight.\\n\\nCOUNT DOOKU: (continuing) I sense great fear in you, Skywalker. You have hate, you have anger, but you don t use them.\\n\\nAnakin regains his composure and attacks COUNT DOOKU as the Dark Lord continues his spin to meet him head on. Their fighting becomes even more intense.\\nAnakin attacks COUNT DOOKU with a new ferociousness.\\n\\n39 INT. GENERAL\\'S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nAnakin and Dooku continue their fight. It is intense! Finally, in one last energized charge, ANAKIN cuts off COUNT DOOKU\\'s hands. The Jedi catches the lightsaber as it drops from the severed Sith Lord\\'s hand. COUNT DOOKU stumbles to the floor as ANAKIN puts the two lightsabers to his neck. PALPATINE is grinning as he watches COUNT DOOKU\\'s defeat.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Good, Anakin, good. I knew you could do it. Kill him. Kill him now!\\n\\nANAKIN: I shouldn\\'t . . .\\n\\nPALPATINE: Do it!!\\n\\nANAKIN cuts off COUNT DOOKU\\'s head. A huge EXPLOSION somewhere deep in the ship rattles everything.\\n\\nANAKIN: ... I couldn\\'t stop myself.\\n\\nPALPATINE: You did well, Anakin. He was too dangerous to be kept alive.\\n\\nANAKIN drops COUNT DOOKU\\'s lightsaber, moving to PALPATINE.\\n\\nANAKIN: Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner.\\n\\nANAKIN raises his hands toward PALPATINE, who is strapped in the Admiral\\'s Chair. The Chancellor\\'s restraints pop loose.\\n\\nANAKIN: (continuing) I shouldn\\'t have done that, Chancellor. It\\'s not the Jedi way.\\n\\nPALPATINE stands up, rubbing his wrists.\\n\\nPALPATINE: It is only natural. He cut off your arm, and you wanted revenge. It wasn\\'t the first time, Anakin. Remember what you told me about your mother and the Sand People. Now, we must leave before more security droids arrive.\\n\\nThe ship begins to list to one side. ANAKIN rushes over to OBI-WAN, lifts the control console from on top of him, and pulls him free. He kneels down and checks out his unconscious friend. PALPATINE heads for the elevators.\\n\\nPALPATINE: (continuing) Anakin, there is no time. We must get off the ship before it\\'s too late.\\n\\nANAKIN: He seems to be all right. No broken bones, breathing\\'s all right.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Leave him, or we\\'ll never make it.\\n\\nANAKIN: His fate will be the same as ours.\\n\\nANAKIN picks up OBI-WAN, slings him over his shoulder, and heads for the elevators.\\n\\n40 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Prepare for attack.\\n\\nPILOT: All batteries fire! Fire!\\n\\n41 INT. BATTLESTATIONS-REPUBLIC CRUISER\\n\\nClone gunners fire on the Trade Federation cruiser and take fire in return. Gun emplacements are destroyed. Clone troopers go flying.\\n\\n42 INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY-GENERAL\\'S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nANAKIN carries OBI-WAN to the elevator doors and hits the button. PALPATINE joins him.\\n\\nANAKIN: The elevator\\'s not working, (into his comlink) Artoo . . .\\n\\nARTOO BEEPS a response to ANAKIN.\\n\\nANAKIN: (continuing) . . . Activate Elevator 3224.\\n\\nSuddenly the ship shifts to its side as the elevator doors open. PALPATINE is thrown to the ground. ANAKIN jumps to the door frame of the elevator. ANAKIN looks into the elevator shaft.\\n\\nANAKIN: (continuing) Artoo ... do you copy? Artoo, come in!\\n\\n43 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nWindows are blown out, droids and equipment are sucked into space.\\n\\nPILOT: Reverse stabilizers.\\n\\n44 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nAs the ship rolls, spacecraft and equipment CRASH from one side of the ship to the other.\\nSeveral objects break through the metal blast doors, causing objects to be sucked into space. ARTOO starts to slide toward one of the small holes.\\n\\n45 INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY-GENERAL\\'S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nAs the elevator shaft rotates, it has become a long hallway.\\nANAKIN clings to the doorframe with OBI-WAN on his shoulder, as the Chancellor struggles to join him.\\n\\n46 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nARTOO continues to skid and slide toward open space. He swerves around boxes and wrecked fighters. One of the BATTLE DROIDS stumbles and is consumed by the electronic shield in a zap. ARTOO BEEPS a reply as he dodges the laser blasts of the BATTLE DROIDS. One bolt hits very near him, and he SCREAMS in terror.\\n\\n47 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nPILOT: Magnetize! Magnetize!\\n\\n48 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nARTOO is about to be overtaken by a starfighter sliding behind him. He falls into a heap of broken battle droid parts and the fighter bounces over him.\\n\\n49 EXT. SPACE-CORUSCANT\\n\\nThe TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER heads straight down toward the planet.\\n\\n50 INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY-GENERAL\\'S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nANAKIN jumps into the horizontal elevator shaft with OBI-WAN still on his shoulder.\\n\\nANAKIN: We can\\'t wait. Come on, we have to be fast.\\n\\nPALPATINE climbs into the elevator shaft also. They start running. The ship begins to roll again, and the Jedi and the Chancellor are forced to jump from one side of the elevator to the other.\\n\\n51 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Fire the emergency booster engines.\\n\\nPILOT: Leveling out, sir.\\n\\n52 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT ON SIDE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nANAKIN still carrying OBI-WAN on his back, and PALPATINE run down the elevator shaft as it starts to move upright. ANAKIN cuts a control box on one of the doors, but before the doors can open, the ship moves to an angle, causing ANAKIN and PALPATINE to start sliding down the shaft. ANAKIN grabs some wires in the control box with one hand. PALPATINE grabs onto the Jedi\\'s leg. As the ship rights itself, they are left hanging in the bottomless elevator shaft.\\n\\n53 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT, VERTICAL-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nANAKIN, OBI-WAN, and PALPATINE hang precariously on the side of the bottomless elevator shaft. OBI-WAN regains consciousness and tries to look around.\\n\\nANAKIN: Easy. . . . We\\'re in a bit of a situation.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Did I miss something?\\n\\nOBI-WAN looks down and sees PALPATINE and the bottomless pit. They hear ARTOO BEEPING on Obi-Wan\\'s comlink. The ship begins to roll, causing the vertical shaft to move into a forty-five-degree angle. They hear the elevator brakes release and look up to see the elevator heading toward them.\\n\\nANAKINN: Hold on.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: What is that?\\n\\nOBI-WAN and ANAKIN look up to watch the elevator approach them at high speed, then OBI-WAN turns to ANAKIN.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) Oops.\\n\\nANAKIN: Artoo, Artoo, shut down the elevator!\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Too late! Jump!\\n\\nThey fall about three hundred feet before the tilt of the ship catches up with them, and they hit the side of the shaft and slide at great speed just ahead of the elevator. The shaft continues to rotate until it is completely horizontal.\\nANAKIN and OBI-WAN take out and throw grappling hooks. The hooks catch and they continue to fall. All the doors in the elevator shaft open up, and the group swings through the open door into a hallway. The elevator roars by.\\n\\n54 INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nANAKIN, OBI-WAN, and PALPATINE fly through the elevator door and land.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Let\\'s see if we can find something in the hangar bay that\\'s still flyable. Come on.\\n\\nANAKIN: Artoo, get down here. Artoo, do you copy?\\n\\n55 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nAs the Federation Cruiser continues to rotate, ARTOO SQUEALS and pokes a periscope out of a pile of broken BATTLE DROID PARTS. He looks around then rockets up out of the debris.\\n\\n56 INT. HALLWAY TO HANGAR BAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nOBI-WAN and ANAKIN lead PALPATINE down a hallway toward the hangar bay.\\n\\n57 INT. DOORWAY TO HANGAR BAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nIt is extremely windy as bits and pieces are continually sucked into space. The hangar bay doors are closed, but great stresses are being exerted as the ship twists, re-entering the atmosphere of Coruscant. They stop in a doorway leading into the hangar bay.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: None of those ships will get us anywhere.\\n\\nANAKIN: I agree.\\n\\nPALPATINE: What are we going to do?\\n\\nANAKIN: I don\\'t know.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Don\\'t look at me. I don\\'t know.\\n\\nANAKIN and PALPATINE both look to OBI-WAN. He shrugs his shoulders. Anakin\\'s Fighter has been sucked out of the hangar bay and is totaled. Suddenly, the ship turns on its side.\\n\\nANAKIN: Here, Chancellor, lock this around your waist, and hold on.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: We\\'ll head toward the bridge and see if we can find an escape pod.\\n\\nANAKIN hands PALPATINE the end of a cable that is attached to his utility belt. PALPATINE attaches it around his waist. ANAKIN and OBI-WAN throw their utility cables to some pipes in the ceiling and swing to a second set of pipes.\\n\\n58 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nOBI-WAN grabs onto the pipes that run along what was the ceiling and is now the wall. As he moves out into the hangar, TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS start firing at him. The Jedi ignites his lightsaber and deflects the bolts back at the DROIDS, blowing them up. ANAKIN and PALPATINE follow OBI-WAN along the pipes running along the ceiling of the hangar. PALPATINE struggles against the escaping air of the pressurized hangar. PALPATINE loses his grip as a pipe breaks, causing a rush of steam, but ANAKIN manages to maintain his grasp on the pipe as the CHANCELLOR dangles on the other end of the utility cable. They are surrounded by SPARKS and EXPLOSIONS as the ship twists and tries to break apart. ANAKIN moves out of the steam and struggles to pull PALPATINE back to safety. ANAKIN is almost pulled loose in the buffeting winds. The ceiling behind them buckles, causing pipes to break, creating geysers of steam. Some bits of pipe go hurling into the blast doors and out into space. They make it through a hangar doorway and close it behind them.\\n\\n59 INT. HANGAR DOORWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nOBI-WAN, ANAKIN and PALPATINE are out of breath.\\n\\nANAKIN/OBI-WAN: Well, that was close.\\n\\nThey laugh.\\n\\n60 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nBODYGUARD: General, we found the Jedi. They\\'re in hallway 328.\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Activate ray shields.\\n\\n61 INT. HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nThey run down the hallway. Suddenly, ray shields drop around them, putting them in an electronic box in the middle of the hallway.\\n\\nANAKIN: Ray shields!\\n\\nOBI-WAN takes a deep breath to express his total disappointment.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Wait a minute, how\\'d this happen! We\\'re smarter than this.\\n\\nANAKIN: Apparently not, Master. This is the oldest trap in the book . . . Well ... I was distracted.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Oh, so all of a sudden it\\'s my fault.\\n\\nANAKIN: You\\'re the Master. I\\'m just a hero.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I\\'m open to suggestions here.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Why don\\'t we let them take us to General Grievous. Perhaps with Count Dooku\\'s demise, we can negotiate our release.\\n\\nThe Jedi look at each other in disbelief.\\n\\nANAKIN: I say . . . patience.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Patience! That\\'s your plan, is it?\\n\\nANAKIN: Yes, Artoo will be along in a few moments and he\\'ll release the ray shields . . .\\n\\nARTOO comes skidding across the hallway and bashes into the opposite wall. He takes a moment to compose himself.\\n\\nANAKIN: (continuing) See! No problem.\\n\\nSuddenly several doorways open, revealing TWO DESTROYER DROIDS. SIXTEEN SUPER BATTLE DROIDS emerge from behind the DESTROYER DROIDS.\\nARTOO turns and zaps one of the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS who then kicks ARTOO over.\\n\\nSUPER BATTLE DROID: Don\\'t move, dummy. Ouch! Zap this.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Do you have a plan B?\\n\\n62 EXT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nOBI-WAN, ANAKIN PALPATINE, and ARTOO are captured by GENERAL GRIEVOUS. They stand before the ALIEN DROID GENERAL.\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Oh yes. General Kenobi, the Negotiator. We\\'ve been waiting for you. That wasn\\'t much of a rescue.\\n\\nA BATTLE DROID walks to GENERAL GRIEVOUS and hands him the JEDI\\'S lightsabers.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: That depends upon your point of view. Hah!\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: And Anakin Skywalker ... I was expecting someone with your reputation to be a little older.\\n\\nANAKIN: General Grievous . . . Supreme Commander of the Droid Armies. You\\'re shorter than I expected.\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Ahhhh, Jedi scum . . .\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Anakin, try not to upset him. We have a job to do.\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Your lightsabers will make a fine addition to my collection.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Not this time. And this time you won\\'t escape.\\n\\nANAKIN: Artoo.\\n\\nARTOO creates a distraction by extending all his arms, shooting out electrical pulses, and bouncing around.\\nOBI-WAN, hands restrained with electrobonds, spins around, reaches out and, using the Force, yanks his lightsaber out of the General\\'s hand, ignites it, and cuts his bonds. He continues to spin around and cuts Anakin free.\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Crush them! Make them suffer!\\n\\nANAKIN uses the Force to yank his lightsaber out of the General\\'s hand.\\n\\nThe DROIDS that surround them begin to FIRE. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN jump into the line of fire. The bridge degenerates into chaos. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN are locked in a pitched battle between electro staffs and laser swords with GENERAL GRIEVOUS\\'s TWO BODYGUARDS.\\n\\nCHANCELLOR PALPATINE is taken away by two BATTLE DROIDS. GENERAL GRIEVOUS walks around the bridge directing the BATTLE DROIDS.\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Stay and watch your stations.\\n\\nOBI-WAN fights one of General Grievous\\'s BODYGUARDS. The BODYGUARD carries an electrified staff about five feet long. When the laser sword hits it, electrical bolts fly everywhere and surround the laser sword. OBI-WAN is unable to cut the staff. The Jedi gets whacked pretty good a couple of times and is knocked halfway across the bridge.\\nOBI-WAN pulls himself together and attacks again, cutting off the DROID BODYGUARD\\'S head. The DROID BODYGUARD keeps attacking. ANAKIN struggles to defend himself against the other manic DROID BODYGUARD. He cuts the DROID BODYGUARD in half. TWO BATTLE DROIDS try to take the CHANCELLOR away.\\nANAKIN follows them down the hallway and cuts them down, rescuing the Chancellor.\\nOBI-WAN finishes off the headless BODYGUARD. It crumbles to the floor in pieces.\\nALARMS SOUND as the giant spacecraft begins to list and fall out of orbit. A PILOT yells at GENERAL GRIEVOUS.\\n\\nPILOT: Sir, we are falling out of orbit. All aft control cells are dead.\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Stay on course . . . Don\\'t bother with them. Keep the ship in orbit.\\n\\nOBI-WAN and ANAKIN destroy the remaining DROIDS. GENERAL GRIEVOUS retrieves one of the BODYGUARD\\'S staffs and faces OBI-WAN. ANAKIN leaps over a console and lands behind GENERAL GRIEVOUS.\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: You lose, General Kenobi.\\n\\nOne of the PILOTS stands next to the General.\\n\\nPILOT: The ship is breaking up!\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: We\\'ve run out of time.\\n\\nOBI-WAN tries to get at GENERAL GRIEVOUS. ANAKIN runs at the General from the opposing side. GENERAL GRIEVOUS turns and throws his electrified staff at the window. It breaks, causing chaos as everything that is not nailed down is sucked into space. GENERAL GRIEVOUS is the first one sucked out into space. He fires a cable from his arm that attaches to the ship. He swings in and lands firmly on the side of the ship.\\nOBI-WAN, ANAKIN, and PALPATINE hold on for dear life. A blast shield closes around where the window used to be.\\n\\n63 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nOBI-WAN continues to fight the BATTLE DROIDS. The DROIDS have backed him into a corner. OBI-WAN hides behind a control panel as the DROIDS blast away at him. He jumps up and over the DROIDS, cutting most of them down before he lands. He destroys the DROIDS and joins ANAKIN.\\nANAKIN and OBI-WAN cut through the rest of the DROIDS as if they were made of butter. PALPATINE stands in shock as he watches the carnage. Droid parts are firing everywhere. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN stand back to back and cut down the last of the DROIDS just as there is a huge shudder, followed by more alarms. SPARKS begin to fly outside the windows.\\n\\nPALPATINE: The hull is burning up!\\n\\n64 EXT. HULL-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER-SPACE\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS detaches his cable and crawls along the exterior hull of the Federation Cruiser, using his magnetized hands and feet. He reaches a row of escape pods and enters an airlock.\\n\\n65 INT. POD BAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER-SPACE\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS enters the escape pod bay through the hatch. The Droid General goes to a control panel and opens an escape pod.\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Time to abandon ship.\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS pulls a row of switches, and one by one the escape pods are jettisoned.\\n\\n66 INT. ESCAPE POD-SPACE\\n\\nHe gets in one, the hatch closes, and the escape pod blasts away from the damaged Cruiser.\\n\\n67 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER\\n\\nOBI-WAN and ANAKIN go over to the navigator\\'s chair.\\n\\nANAKIN: All the escape pods have been launched.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Grievous. Can you fly a cruiser like this?\\n\\nANAKIN: You mean, do I know how to land what\\'s left of this thing?\\n\\nANAKIN sits in the pilot\\'s chair and sees on a screen the back half of the ship break away. There is a great jolt, and the ship tilts forward.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Well?\\n\\nANAKIN: Under the circumstances, I\\'d say the ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant. Strap yourselves in.\\n\\nOBI-WAN and PALPATINE strap themselves into chairs. ANAKIN struggles with the controls of the ship. The ship starts to glow, and pieces break off. ARTOO moves in on Palpatine \\'s controls and assists in flying the cruiser.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Steady . . . Attitude . . . eighteen degrees.\\n\\nARTOO beeps.\\n\\nANAKIN: Pressure rising. We\\'ve got to slow this wreck down. Open all hatches, extend all flaps, and drag fins.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Temp steady. Hatches open, flaps extended, drag fins . . .\\n\\nA large part of the ship breaks away.\\n\\nANAKIN: We lost something.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Not to worry, we\\'re still flying half the ship.\\n\\nANAKIN: Now we\\'re really picking up speed . . . I\\'m going to shift a few degrees and see if I can slow us down.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Careful . . . we\\'re heating up-twelve thousand . . . thirteen thousand . . .\\n\\nANAKIN: What\\'s our speed?\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Eight plus sixty-forty. Eight plus sixty-twenty. Eight plus sixty. Temp ten thousand, nine thousand . . . we\\'re in the atmosphere . . .\\n\\nANAKIN points to one of the controls. ARTOO beeps madly.\\n\\nANAKIN: Grab that . . . Keep us level.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Steady. Steady.\\n\\nANAKIN: Easy, Artoo. Hang on, this may get a little rough. We lost our heat shields.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Five thousand. Three thousand . . . two thousand. Fireships on the left and the right.\\n\\nFlRESHIP PILOT: We\\'ll take you in.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Copy that. Landing strip\\'s straight ahead.\\n\\nANAKIN: We\\'re coming in too hot.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Easy-easy.\\n\\nThe ship leaves a contrail as it streaks across the Coruscant skyline. PALPATINE and OBI-WAN hold on for dear life as the ship shakes and rattles toward an industrial landing platform.\\n\\n68 EXT. CORUSCANT-INDUSTRIAL LANDING PLATFORM-AFTERNOON\\n\\nA large landing platform in the industrial part of the city is surrounded by Emergency Fire Speeders. The smoking ship approaches as five Fireships spray it with foam. The ship finally makes a rather hard landing.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Another happy landing.\\n\\n69 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-LANDING PLATFORM-LATE AFTERNOON\\n\\nThe small Jedi Shuttle carrying PALPATINE and the JEDI arrives at the landing platform. There are a DOZEN SENATORS, including BAIL ORGANA, JAR JAR BINKS, and C-3PO, waiting for them. PALPATINE, R2-D2, and ANAKIN get out. OBI-WAN and MACE stay in the doorway of the Jedi Shuttle.\\n\\nANAKIN: (to Obi-Wan) Are you coming, Master?\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Oh no. I\\'m not brave enough for politics. I have to report to the Council. Besides, someone needs to be the poster boy.\\n\\nANAKIN: Hold on, this whole operation was your idea. You planned it. You led the rescue operation. You have to be the one to take the bows this time.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Sorry, old friend. Let us not forget that you rescued me from the Buzz Droids. And you killed Count Dooku. And you rescued the Chancellor, carrying me unconscious on your back, and you managed to land that bucket of bolts safely . . .\\n\\nANAKIN: All because of your training, Master. You deserve all those speeches of your greatness.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: . . . the endless speeches . . . Anakin, let\\'s be fair. Today, you are the hero and you deserve your glorious day with the politicians.\\n\\nANAKIN: All right. But you owe me . . . and not for saving your skin for the tenth time . . .\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Ninth time . . . that business on Cato Nemoidia doesn\\'t count. I\\'ll see you at the briefing.\\n\\nANAKIN smiles and walks away from OBI-WAN.\\nThe CHANCELLOR and his entourage approach MACE.\\n\\nMACE WlNDU: Chancellor Palpatine, what a welcome sight! Are you all right?\\n\\nPALPATINE: Yes, thanks to your two Jedi Knights. They killed Count Dooku, but General Grievous has escaped once again.\\n\\nMACE WlNDU: General Grievous will run and hide as he always does. He is a coward.\\n\\nPALPATINE: That maybe true, but with Count Dooku dead, he is the leader of the Droid Army, and I assure you, the Senate will vote to continue the war as long as Grievous is alive.\\n\\nMACE WlNDU: Then the Jedi Council will make finding Grievous our highest priority.\\n\\nBAIL, ANAKIN, and the crowd walk away from the platform toward the Senate Building Grand Hallway.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: Skywalker, the Republic cannot praise you enough.\\n\\nANAKIN and BAIL ORGANA, walking in the hallway.\\n\\nANAKIN: Thank you, Senator Organa. The kidnapping was a bold move by the Separatists, but it was a mistake that Obi-Wan and I were able to take advantage of.\\n\\nARTOO and THREEPIO follow behind the crowd.\\n\\nC-3PO: It couldn\\'t possibly be as bad as all that.\\n\\nARTOO beeps.\\n\\nC-3PO: (continuing) Well, there, I agree with you. In fact, I could do with a tune-up myself.\\n\\n70 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-MAIN HALLWAY-LATE AFTERNOON\\n\\nANAKIN is at the back of the crowd of SENATORS, talking with BAIL ORGANA. R2-D2 and C-3PO scoot along ahead of them.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: The end of Count Dooku will surely bring an end to this war, and an end to the Chancellor\\'s draconian security measures.\\n\\nANAKIN: I wish that were so, but the fighting is going to continue until General Grievous is spare parts . . . The Chancellor is very clear about that.\\n\\nBehind a row of large columns, a SHADOWY FIGURE follows the JEDI and the SENATOR. ANAKIN senses the figure.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: I\\'ll do everything I can with the Senate.\\n\\nANAKIN: Excuse me.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: Certainly.\\n\\nANAKIN stops, and BAIL goes off after PALPATINE and the others. ANAKIN goes behind one of the giant columns to meet up with the SHADOWY FIGURE, who is revealed to be SENATOR PADME AMDALA. They embrace and kiss.\\n\\nPADME: Oh, Anakin! Thank goodness, you\\'re back.\\n\\nANAKIN: I missed you, Padme. I\\'ve missed you so.\\n\\nPADME: There were whispers . . . that you\\'d been killed. I\\'ve been living with unbearable dread.\\n\\nANAKIN: I\\'m back, I\\'m all right. It feels like we\\'ve been apart for a lifetime. And it might have been ... If the Chancellor hadn\\'t been kidnapped. I don\\'t think they would have ever brought us back from the Outer Rim sieges.\\n\\nANAKIN starts to give her another kiss. She steps back.\\n\\nPADME: Wait, not here . . .\\n\\nHe grabs her again.\\n\\nANAKIN: Yes, here! I\\'m tired of all this deception. I don\\'t care if they know we\\'re married.\\n\\nPADME: Anakin, don\\'t say things like that. You\\'re important to the Republic ... to ending this war. I love you more than anything, but I won\\'t let you give up your life as a Jedi for me . . .\\n\\nANAKIN: I\\'ve given my life to the Jedi order, but I\\'d only give up my life, for you.\\n\\nPADME: (playfully) I wouldn\\'t like that. I wouldn\\'t like that one bit. Patience, my handsome Jedi . . . Come to me later.\\n\\nANAKIN embraces her, then looks at her.\\n\\nANAKIN: Are you all right? You\\'re trembling. What\\'s going on?\\n\\nPADME: I\\'m just excited to see you.\\n\\nANAKIN: That\\'s not it. I sense more . . . what is it?\\n\\nPADME: Nothing . . . nothing . . .\\n\\nANAKIN: You\\'re frightened. (a little angry) Tell me what\\'s going on!\\n\\nPADME begins to cry.\\n\\nPADME: You\\'ve been gone five months . . . it\\'s been very hard for me. I\\'ve never felt so alone. There\\'s . . .\\n\\nANAKIN: . . . Is there someone else?\\n\\nPADME: (peeved, angry) No! Why do you think that? Your jealousy upsets me so much, Anakin. I do nothing to betray you, yet you still don\\'t trust me. Nothing has changed.\\n\\nANAKIN: (sheepish) I\\'m afraid of losing you, Padme . . . that\\'s all.\\n\\nPADME: I will never stop loving you, Anakin. My only fear is losing you.\\n\\nANAKIN: It\\'s just that I\\'ve never seen you like this . . .\\n\\nPADME: Something wonderful has happened.\\n\\nThey look at each other for a long moment.\\n\\nPADME: (continuing) I\\'m . . . Annie, I\\'m pregnant.\\n\\nANAKIN is stunned. He thinks through all of the ramifications of this. He takes her in his arms.\\n\\nANAKIN: That\\'s . . . that\\'s wonderful.\\n\\nPADME: What are we going to do?\\n\\nANAKIN: We\\'re not going to worry about anything right now, all right? This is a happy moment. The happiest moment of my life.\\n\\n71 EXT. UTAPAU-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY\\n\\nA small NEIMOIDIAN SHUTTLE lands. BATTLE DROIDS surround the ramp as GENERAL GRIEVOUS descends onto the platform. SUPER BATTLE DROID G21 approaches.\\n\\nSUPER BATTLE DROID G21: The planet is secure, sir. The population is under control.\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Good. Where is the Separatist Council?\\n\\nSUPER BATTLE DROID G21: This way, sir ...\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS takes the elevator to an upper level. He enters a conference room and presses a series of buttons on the table, and bows.\\n\\n72 INT. UTAPAU-CONFERENCE ROOM-GRAND CHAMBER-DAY\\n\\nA hologram of Darth Sidious appears.\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Yes, Lord Sidious.\\n\\nDARTH SlDIOUS: General Grievous, I suggest you move the Separatist leaders to Mustafar.\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: It will be done, My Lord.\\n\\nDARTH SlDIOUS: The end of the war is near, General, and I promise you, victory is assured.\\n\\nThe hologram of Sidious talks to GRIEVOUS about the death of Count Dooku.\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: But the loss of Count Dooku?\\n\\nDARTH SlDIOUS: His death was a necessary loss, which will ensure our victory. Soon I will have a new apprentice . . . one far younger and more powerful than Lord Tyranus.\\n\\n73 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME\\'S APARTMENT-TWILIGHT\\n\\nPADME stands in the balcony brushing her hair. ANAKIN leans against the wall, watching her lovingly.\\n\\nANAKIN: . . . every second I was thinking of you. Protecting the endless, nameless Outer Rim settlements became a torture . . . the battles were easy, the longing became unbearable . . . I\\'ve never been so happy as I am at this moment.\\n\\nPADME: Annie, I want to have our baby back home on Naboo. We could go to the lake country where no one would know . . . where we would be safe. I could go early-and fix up the baby\\'s room. I know the perfect spot, right by the gardens.\\n\\nANAKIN: You are so beautiful!\\n\\nPADME: It\\'s only because I\\'m so in love . . .\\n\\nANAKIN: No, it\\'s because I\\'m so in love with you.\\n\\nPADME: So love has blinded you?\\n\\nANAKIN: Well, that\\'s not exactly what I meant . . .\\n\\nPADME: But it\\'s probably true!\\n\\nThey laugh.\\n\\nANAKIN: I haven\\'t laughed in so long . . .\\n\\nPADME: Neither have I.\\n\\n74 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-DREAM\\n\\nThe view is strangely distorted and disorienting. PADME is on a table in an alien medical chamber. She is giving birth and is screaming.\\n\\nPADME: Anakin, help me! Help, Anakin! Anakin, I love you. I love you.\\n\\nShe screams and dies.\\n\\n75 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME\\'S APARTMENT-BEDROOM-NIGHT\\n\\nANAKIN awakens in a panic. He is covered in sweat. He looks over in the bed and sees PADME sound asleep next to him. ANAKIN gets out from under the sheets and sits on the side of the bed. He is breathing heavily. He puts his head in his hands and weeps. He regains his composure and leaves the room down a set of stairs. PADME awakens, realizes Anakin is gone.\\n\\nPADME: Anakin??\\n\\nShe gets out of bed and goes downstairs to look for him.\\n\\n76 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME\\'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-NIGHT\\n\\nANAKIN walks down a flight of stairs onto a large veranda. The vast city planet of Coruscant, smoldering from the battle, is spread out before him. He is distraught.\\nPADME descends the stairs and joins ANAKIN on the veranda. She takes his hand. He doesn\\'t look at her.\\n\\nPADME: What\\'s bothering you?\\n\\nANAKIN: Nothing . . .\\n\\nANAKIN touches the japor snippet around PADME\\'S neck, that Anakin gave her when he was a small boy.\\n\\nANAKIN: (continuing) I remember when I gave this to you.\\n\\nPADME: Anakin, how long is it going to take for us to be honest with each other?\\n\\nANAKIN: It was a dream.\\n\\nPADME: Bad?\\n\\nANAKIN: Like the ones I used to have about my mother just before she died.\\n\\nPADME: And?\\n\\nANAKIN: It was about you.\\n\\nThey look at each other. A moment of concern passes between them.\\n\\nPADME: Tell me.\\n\\nANAKIN: It was only a dream.\\n\\nPADME gives him a long, worried look. ANAKIN takes a deep breath.\\n\\nANAKIN: (continuing) You die in childbirth . . .\\n\\nPADME: And the baby?\\n\\nANAKIN: I don\\'t know.\\n\\nPADME: It was only a dream.\\n\\nANAKIN takes PADME in his arms.\\n\\nANAKIN: . . . I won\\'t let this one become real, Padme.\\n\\nThey embrace, then part.\\n\\nPADME: Anakin, this baby will change our lives. I doubt the Queen will continue to allow me to serve in the Senate, and if the Council discovers you are the father, you will be expelled from the Jedi Order.\\n\\nANAKIN: I know  .\\n\\nPADME: Anakin, do you think Obi-Wan might be able to help us?\\n\\nANAKIN: (suspicious) Have you told him anything?\\n\\nPADME: No, but he\\'s your mentor, your best friend . . . he must suspect something.\\n\\nANAKIN: He\\'s been a father to me, but he\\'s still on the Council. Don\\'t tell him anything!\\n\\nPADME: I won\\'t, Anakin.\\n\\nANAKIN: I don\\'t need his help . . . Our baby is a blessing, not a problem.\\n\\n77 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-YODAS QUARTERS-DAY\\n\\nYODA and ANAKIN sit in Yoda \\'s room, deep in thought.\\n\\nYODA: Premonitions . . . premonitions . . . Hmmmm . . . these visions you have . . .\\n\\nANAKIN: They are of pain, suffering, death . . .\\n\\nYODA: Yourself you speak of, or someone you know?\\n\\nANAKIN: Someone . . .\\n\\nYODA: . . . close to you?\\n\\nANAKIN: Yes.\\n\\nYODA: Careful you must be when sensing the future, Anakin. The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.\\n\\nANAKIN: I won\\'t let these visions come true, Master Yoda.\\n\\nYODA: Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not. Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed, that is.\\n\\nANAKIN: What must I do, Master Yoda?\\n\\nYODA: Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.\\n\\n78 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-HALLWAY-DAY\\n\\nANAKIN hurries down a temple hallway, heading toward a Jedi Briefing Room. SEVERAL JEDI are exiting.\\n\\n79 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-BRIEFING ROOM-DAY\\n\\nANAKIN rushes into the Briefing Room. By the time he reaches the Chamber, the last of the Jedi are leaving. Only OBI-WAN remains at the front of the lecture hall. He is shutting off some holograms and electronic charts and maps.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: You missed the report on the Outer Rim sieges.\\n\\nANAKIN: I\\'m sorry, I was held up. I have no excuse.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: In short, they are going very well. Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos has moved his troops to Boz Pity.\\n\\nANAKIN: What\\'s wrong then?\\n\\nOBI-WAN: The Senate is expected to vote more executive powers to the Chancellor today.\\n\\nANAKIN: Well, that can only mean less deliberating and more action. Is that bad? It will make it easier for us to end this war.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Anakin, be careful of your friend Palpatine.\\n\\nANAKIN: Be careful of what?\\n\\nOBI-WAN: He has requested your presence.\\n\\nANAKIN: What for?\\n\\nOBI-WAN: He would not say.\\n\\nANAKIN: He didn\\'t inform the Jedi Council? That\\'s unusual, isn\\'t it?\\n\\nOBI-WAN: All of this is unusual, and it\\'s making me feel uneasy. You\\'re probably aware that relations between the Council and the Chancellor are stressed.\\n\\nANAKIN: I know the Council has grown wary of the Chancellor\\'s power, mine also for that matter. Aren\\'t we all working together to save the Republic? Why all this distrust?\\n\\nOBI-WAN: The Force grows dark, Anakin, and we are all affected by it. Be wary of your feelings.\\n\\n80 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR\\'S OFFICE-DAY\\n\\nANAKIN stands with PALPATINE at his window overlooking the vastness of Coruscant. Several buildings have been destroyed. A brown haze hangs over the landscape.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Anakin, this afternoon the Senate is going to call on me to take direct control of the Jedi Council.\\n\\nANAKIN: The Jedi will no longer report to the Senate?\\n\\nPALPATINE: They will report to me . . . personally. The Senate is too unfocused to conduct a war. This will bring a quick end to things.\\n\\nANAKIN: I agree, but the Jedi Council may not see it that way.\\n\\nPALPATINE: There are times when we must all endure adjustments to the constitution in the name of security.\\n\\nANAKIN: With all due respect, sir, the Council is in no mood for more constitutional amendments.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Thank you, my friend, but in this case I have no choice . . . this war must be won.\\n\\nANAKIN: Everyone will agree on that.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Anakin, I\\'ve known you since you were a small boy. I have advised you over the years when I could ... I am very proud of your accomplishments. You have won many battles the Jedi Council thought were lost . . . and you saved my life. I hope you trust me, Anakin.\\n\\nANAKIN: Of course.\\n\\nPALPATINE: I need your help, son.\\n\\nANAKIN: What do you mean?\\n\\nPALPATINE: I fear the Jedi. The Council keeps pushing for more control. They\\'re shrouded in secrecy and obsessed with maintaining their autonomy . . . ideals. I find simply incomprehensible in a democracy.\\n\\nANAKIN: I can assure you that the Jedi are dedicated to the values of the Republic, sir.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Nevertheless, their actions will speak more loudly than their words. I\\'m depending on you.\\n\\nANAKIN: For what? I don\\'t understand.\\n\\nPALPATINE: To be the eyes, ears, and voice of the Republic . . .\\n\\nANAKIN thinks about this.\\n\\nPALPATINE: (continuing) Anakin . . . I\\'m appointing you to be my personal representative on the Jedi Council.\\n\\nANAKIN: Me? A Master? I am overwhelmed, sir, but the Council elects its own members. They will never accept this.\\n\\nPALPATINE: I think they will . . . they need you more than you know.\\n\\n81 INT. CORUSCANT-BAIL ORGANA\\'S OFFICE-DAY\\n\\nPADME, BAIL ORGANA, and SENATORS MON MOTHMA, FANG ZAR, TERR TANEEL, and GIDDEAN DANU sit in Senator Organa \\'s office.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: Now that he has control of the Jedi Council, the Chancellor has appointed Governors to oversee all star systems in the Republic.\\n\\nFANG ZAR: When did this happen?\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: The decree was posted this morning.\\n\\nPADME: Do you think he will dismantle the Senate?\\n\\nMON MOTHMA: Why bother? As a practical matter, the Senate no longer exists.\\n\\nGIDDEAN DANU: The constitution is in shreds. Amendment after amendment . . . executive directives, sometimes a dozen in one day.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: We can\\'t let a thousand years of democracy disappear without a fight.\\n\\nEVERYONE looks at each other, a little worried at the implications of what was just said.\\n\\nTERR TANEEL: What are you suggesting?\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: I apologize. I didn\\'t mean to sound like a Separatist.\\n\\nMON MOTHMA: We are not Separatists trying to leave the Republic. We are loyalists, trying to preserve democracy in the Republic.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: It has become increasingly clear to many of us that the Chancellor has become an enemy of democracy.\\n\\nPADME: I can\\'t believe it has come to this! Chancellor Palpatine is one of my oldest advisors. He served as my Ambassador when I was Queen.\\n\\nGlDDEAN DANU: Senator, I fear you underestimate the amount of corruption that has taken hold in the Senate.\\n\\nMON MOTHMA: The Chancellor has played the Senators well. They know where the power lies, and they will do whatever it takes to share in it. Palpatine has become a dictator and we have helped him to do it.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: We can\\'t sit around debating any longer, we have decided to do what we can to stop it. Senator Mon Mothma and I are putting together an organization . . .\\n\\nPADME: Say no more. Senator Organa. I understand. At this point, it\\'s better to leave some things unsaid.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: Yes. I agree and we must not discuss this with anyone, without everyone in this group agreeing.\\n\\nMON MOTHMA: That means those closest to you . . . even family ... no one can be told.\\n\\nThey ALL nod their heads. PADME considers this for a moment.\\n\\nPADME: Agreed.\\n\\n82 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-HALLWAY OUTSIDE COUNCIL CHAMBERS-DAY\\n\\nANAKIN stands pensively in front of the Jedi Council Chambers. The door opens.\\n\\n83 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-COUNCIL CHAMBERS-DAY\\n\\nANAKIN enters and stands in the middle of the room. He is surrounded by the Jedi Council MACE WINDU, EETH KOTH OBI-WAN, YODA, the HOLOGRAMS of PLO KOON and KI-ADI-MUNDI.\\n\\nMACE: Anakin Skywalker, we have approved your appointment to the Council as the Chancellor\\'s personal representative.\\n\\nANAKIN: I will do my best to uphold the principles of the Jedi Order.\\n\\nYODA: Allow this appointment lightly, the Council does not. Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine.\\n\\nANAKIN: I understand.\\n\\nMACE: You are on this Council, but we do not grant you the rank of Master.\\n\\nAnakin reacts with anger.\\n\\nANAKIN: What? ! How can you do this?? This is outrageous, it\\'s unfair . . . I\\'m more powerful than any of you. How can you be on the Council and not be a Master?\\n\\nMACE: Take a seat, young Skywalker.\\n\\nANAKIN: Forgive me, Master.\\n\\nANAKIN goes and sits in one of the empty chairs. Everyone is embarrassed. KI-ADI-MUNDI WHO APPEARS AS A HOLOGRAM, speaks.\\n\\nKl-ADI-MUNDI: We have surveyed all systems in the Republic, and have found no sign of General Grievous.\\n\\nYODA: Hiding in the Outer Rim, Grievous is. The outlying systems, you must sweep.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: It may take some time . . . we do not have many ships to spare.\\n\\nMACE: We cannot take ships from the front line.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: And yet, it would be fatal for us to allow the droid armies to regroup.\\n\\nYODA: Master Kenobi, our spies contact, you must, and then wait.\\n\\nKl-ADI-MUNDI: What about the droid attack on the Wookiees?\\n\\nMACE: It is critical we send an attack group there, immediately!\\n\\nOBI-WAN: He\\'s right, that is a system we cannot afford to lose. It\\'s the main navigation route for the southwestern quadrant.\\n\\nANAKIN: I know that system well. It would take us little time to drive the droids off that planet.\\n\\nMACE: Skywalker, your assignment is here with the Chancellor, and Kenobi must find General Grievous.\\n\\nYODA: Go, I will. Good relations with the Wookiees, I have.\\n\\nMACE: It is settled then. Yoda will take a battalion of clones to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk. May the Force be with us all.\\n\\nANAKIN is disappointed.\\n\\n84 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-MASSIVE MAIN HALLWAY AND ALCOVE-LATE AFTERNOON\\n\\nANAKIN and OBI-WAN walk through one of the massive Jedi Temple hallways. ANAKIN is furious.\\n\\nANAKIN: What kind of nonsense is this, put me on the Council and not make me a Master!?? That\\'s never been done in the history of the Jedi. It\\'s insulting!\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Calm down, Anakin. You have been given a great honor. To be on the Council at your age . . . It\\'s never happened before. Listen to me, Anakin. The fact of the matter is you\\'re too close to the Chancellor. The Council doesn\\'t like it when he interferes in Jedi affairs.\\n\\nANAKIN: I swear to you, I didn\\'t ask to be put on the Council . . .\\n\\nOBI-WAN: But it\\'s what you wanted! Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine seems to have paid off.\\n\\nANAKIN: That has nothing to do with this.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Anakin, regardless of how it happened, you find yourself in a delicate situation.\\n\\nANAKIN: You mean divided loyalties.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I warned you there was tension between the Council and the Chancellor. I was very clear. Why didn\\'t you listen? You walked right into it.\\n\\nANAKIN: The Council is upset I\\'m the youngest to ever serve.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: No, it is not. Anakin, I worry when you speak of jealousy and pride. Those are not Jedi thoughts. They\\'re dangerous, dark thoughts.\\n\\nANAKIN: Master, you of all people should have confidence in my abilities. I know where my loyalties lie.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I hope so . . .\\n\\nANAKIN: I sense there\\'s more to this talk than you\\'re saying.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Anakin, the only reason the Council has approved your appointment is because the Chancellor trusts you.\\n\\nANAKIN: And?\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Anakin, look, I am on your side. I didn\\'t want to see you put in this situation.\\n\\nANAKIN: What situation?\\n\\nOBI-WAN: (takes a deep breath) The Council wants you to report on all of the Chancellor\\'s dealings. They want to know what he\\'s up to.\\n\\nANAKIN: They want me to spy on the Chancellor? That\\'s treason!\\n\\nOBI-WAN: We are at war, Anakin. The Jedi Council is sworn to uphold the principles of the Republic, even if the Chancellor does not.\\n\\nANAKIN: Why didn\\'t the Council give me this assignment when we were in session?\\n\\nOBI-WAN: This assignment is not to be on record. The Council asked me to approach you on this personally.\\n\\nANAKIN: The Chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan. He befriended me. He\\'s watched out for me ever since I arrived here.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: That is why you must help us, Anakin. Our allegiance is to the Senate, not to its leader who has managed to stay in office long after his term has expired.\\n\\nANAKIN: Master, the Senate demanded that he stay longer.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin. Something is out of place.\\n\\nANAKIN: You\\'re asking me to do something against the Jedi Code. Against the Republic. Against a mentor . . . and a friend. That\\'s what\\'s out of place here. Why are you asking this of me?\\n\\nOBI-WAN: The Council is asking you.\\n\\n85 EXT. CORUSCANT-CLONE LANDING PLATFORM-DAY\\n\\nA JEDI GUNSHIP heads for the huge Clone landing platform.\\n\\n86 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI GUNSHIP-DAY\\n\\nYODA, MACE, and OBI-WAN ride in the GUNSHIP as it heads for the Clone landing platform. Mace and Obi-Wan are sitting.\\n\\nOBI-WAN : Anakin did not take to his assignment with much enthusiasm.\\n\\nYODA: Too much under the sway of the Chancellor, he is. Much anger there is in him. Too much pride in his powers.\\n\\nMACE: It\\'s very dangerous, putting them together. I don\\'t think the boy can handle it. I don\\'t trust him.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: He\\'ll be all right. I trust him with my life.\\n\\nMACE:I wish I did.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: With all due respect, Master, is he not the Chosen One? Is he not to destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force?\\n\\nMACE: So the prophecy says.\\n\\nYODA: A prophecy . . . that misread could have been.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: He will not let me down. He never has.\\n\\nYODA: I hope right you are. And now destroy the Droid armies on Kashyyyk, I will. May the Force be with you.\\n\\nThe GUNSHIP lands and the ramp lowers. YODA exits the GUNSHIP. MACE and OBI-WAN stand and give him a brief bow then take off in the GUNSHIP.\\n\\n87 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME\\'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-SUNSET\\n\\nPadme\\'s Speeder pulls up to the landing platform. CAPTAIN TYPHO escorts PADME onto the veranda, where TWO HANDMAIDENS (ELLE and MOTEE) are waiting. PADME turns to CAPTAIN TYPHO.\\n\\nPADME: Thank you, Captain.\\n\\nCAPTAIN TYPHO: Rest well. My Lady.\\n\\nCAPTAIN TYPHO gets back into the Speeder, and it disappears into the cityscape. The HANDMAIDENS, Motee and Elle, approach PADME as the SHADOW OF A FIGURE moves in the background. C-3PO is standing nearby.\\n\\nPADME: I\\'ll be up in a while.\\n\\nMOTEE: Yes, my lady.\\n\\nC-3PO stands, confused, as the HANDMAIDENS turn and exit.\\n\\nC-3PO: Is there anything I might do for you, my lady?\\n\\nPADME: Yes, make sure all the security droids are working. Thank you, Threepio.\\n\\nThe golden droid turns and exits.\\n\\nPADME stands and watches the sunset. The SHADOWY FIGURE moves toward her. She senses something.\\n\\nANAKIN: Beautiful, isn\\'t it?\\n\\nPADME jumps and turns around.\\n\\nPADME: You startled me.\\n\\nHe sits next to her on the bench.\\n\\nANAKIN: How are you feeling?\\n\\nPADME: He keeps kicking.\\n\\nANAKIN: He?! Why do you think it\\'s a boy?\\n\\nPADME: (laughs) My motherly intuition.\\n\\nShe puts his hand on her belly.\\n\\nANAKIN: Whoa! With a kick that strong, it\\'s got to be a girl.\\n\\nThey laugh.\\n\\nPADME: I heard about your appointment. Anakin. I\\'m so proud of you.\\n\\nANAKIN: I may be on the Council, but . . . they refused to accept me as a Jedi Master.\\n\\nPADME: Patience. In time, they will recognize your skills.\\n\\nANAKIN: They still treat me as if I were a Padawan learner. . . they fear my power, that\\'s the problem.\\n\\nPADME: Anakin . . .\\n\\nANAKIN: Sometimes, I wonder what\\'s happening to the Jedi Order . . . I think this war is destroying the principles of the Republic.\\n\\nPADME: Have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side?\\n\\nANAKIN: (suspicious) What do you mean?\\n\\nPADME: What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists, and the Republic has become the very evil we have been fighting to destroy?\\n\\nANAKIN: I don\\'t believe that. And you\\'re sounding like a Separatist!\\n\\nPADME: Anakin, this war represents a failure to listen . . . Now, you\\'re closer to the Chancellor than anyone. Please, please ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume.\\n\\nANAKIN: (growing angry) Don\\'t ask me to do that, Padme. Make a motion in the Senate, where that kind of a request belongs. I\\'m not your errand boy. I\\'m not anyone\\'s errand boy!\\n\\nPADME: What is it?\\n\\nANAKIN: Nothing.\\n\\nPADME: Don\\'t do this . . . don\\'t shut me out. Let me help you.\\n\\nANAKIN: You can\\'t help me . . . I\\'m trying to help you.\\n\\nThey look in each other\\'s eyes.\\n\\nANAKIN: (continuing) I sense . . . there are things you are not telling me.\\n\\nPADME is startled at this.\\n\\nPADME: I sense there are things you are not telling me.\\n\\nPADME smiles. ANAKIN is a little embarrassed.\\n\\nPADME: (continuing) Hold me . . . like you did by the lake on Naboo, so long ago . . . when there was nothing but our love ... No politics, no plotting ... no war.\\n\\n88 INT. CORUSCANT-GALAXIES OPERA HOUSE-NIGHT\\n\\nANAKIN lands his speeder and exits.\\nANAKIN runs up the stairs at the Galaxies Opera House.\\nANAKIN runs through the hallway and enters Palpatine\\'s box, where the CHANCELLOR is sitting with Mas Amedda and Sly-Moore, watching the Man Calamari Ballet doing \"Squid Lake.\"\\n\\nANAKIN: You wanted to see me, Chancellor.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Yes, Anakin! Come closer. I have good news. Our Clone Intelligence Units have discovered the location of General Grievous. He is hiding in the Utapau system.\\n\\nANAKIN: At last, we\\'ll be able to capture that monster and end this war.\\n\\nPALPATINE: I would worry about the collective wisdom of the Council if they didn\\'t select you for this assignment. You are the best choice by far   but, they can\\'t always be trusted to do the right thing.\\n\\nANAKIN: They try.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Sit down, (to his aides) Leave us.\\n\\nANAKIN sits next to PALPATINE. The Chancellor leans over to him.\\n\\nPALPATINE: (continuing) Anakin, you know I\\'m not able to rely on the Jedi Council. If they haven\\'t included you in their plot, they soon will.\\n\\nANAKIN: I\\'m not sure I understand.\\n\\nPALPATINE: You must sense what I have come to suspect . . . the Jedi Council want control of the Republic . . . they\\'re planning to betray me.\\n\\nANAKIN: I don\\'t think . . .\\n\\nPALPATINE: Anakin, search your feelings. You know, don\\'t you?\\n\\nANAKIN: I know they don\\'t trust you . . .\\n\\nPALPATINE: Or the Senate . . . or the Republic . . . or democracy for that matter.\\n\\nANAKIN: I have to admit my trust in them has been shaken.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Why? They asked you to do something that made you feel dishonest, didn\\'t they?\\n\\nANAKIN doesn\\'t say anything. He simply looks down.\\n\\nPALPATINE: (continuing) They asked you to spy on me, didn\\'t they?\\n\\nANAKIN: I don\\'t know ... I don\\'t know what to say.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Remember back to your early teachings. Anakin. \"All those who gain power are afraid to lose it.\" Even the Jedi.\\n\\nANAKIN: The Jedi use their power for good.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Good is a point of view, Anakin. And the Jedi point of view is not the only valid one. The Dark Lords of the Sith believe in security and justice also, yet they are considered by the Jedi to be. . .\\n\\nANAKIN: . . . evil.\\n\\nPALPATINE: . . . from a Jedi\\'s point of view. The Sith and the Jedi are similar in almost every way, including their quest for greater power. The difference between the two is the Sith are not afraid of the dark side of the Force. That is why they are more powerful.\\n\\nANAKIN: The Sith rely on their passion for their strength. They think inward, only about themselves.\\n\\nPALPATINE: And the Jedi don\\'t?\\n\\nANAKIN: The Jedi are selfless . . . they only care about others.\\n\\nPALPATINE smiles.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Or so you\\'ve been trained to believe. Why is it, then, that they have asked you to do something you feel is wrong?\\n\\nANAKIN: I\\'m not sure it\\'s wrong.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Have they asked you to betray the Jedi code? The Constitution? A friendship? Your own values? Think. Consider their motives. Keep your mind clear of assumptions. The fear of losing power is a weakness of both the Jedi and the Sith.\\n\\nANAKIN is deep in thought.\\n\\nPALPATINE: (continuing) Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis \"the wise\"?\\n\\nANAKIN: No.\\n\\nPALPATINE: I thought not. It\\'s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It\\'s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create life ... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.\\n\\nANAKIN: He could actually save people from death?\\n\\nPALPATINE: The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.\\n\\nANAKIN: What happened to him?\\n\\nPALPATINE: He became so powerful . . . the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. (smiles) Plagueis never saw it coming. It\\'s ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.\\n\\nANAKIN: Is it possible to learn this power?\\n\\nPALPATINE: Not from a Jedi.\\n\\n89 EXT. KASHYYYK-DAY\\n\\nA WOOKIEE CATAMARAN flanked by WOOKIEE HELICOPTERS approaches the tree housing the HOLOGRAM AREA.\\n\\n90 INT. KASHYYYK-HOLOGRAM AREA-DAY\\n\\nYODA and various JEDI speak via hologram. The discussion includes OBI-WAN, MACE, AGEN KOLAR, YODA- KI-ADI-MUNDI and PLO KOON.\\n\\nKl-ADI-MUNDI: (holo) Palpatine thinks General Grievous is on Utapau. We have had no reports of this from our agents.\\n\\nMACE: (holo) How could the Chancellor have come by this information and we know nothing about it? We have had contact with Baron Papanoida and he said no one was there.\\n\\nANAKIN: A partial message was intercepted in a diplomatic packet from the Chairman of Utapau.\\n\\nYODA: Act on this, we must. The capture of General Grievous will end this war. Quickly and decisively we should proceed.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Does everyone agree?\\n\\nAll the JEDI concur.\\n\\nANAKIN: The Chancellor has requested that I lead the campaign.\\n\\nThey all look at ANAKIN a bit disturbed.\\n\\nMACE: (a little peeved) The Council will make up its own mind who is to go, not the Chancellor.\\n\\nKl-ADI-MUNDI: Yes, this decision is ours to make.\\n\\nANAKIN is embarrassed and becomes sullen.\\n\\nYODA: A Master is needed, with more experience.\\n\\nMACE: Given our resources, I recommend we send only one Jedi . . . Master Kenobi.\\n\\nANAKIN: He was not so successful the last time he met Grievous.\\n\\nOBI-WAN throws ANAKIN a dirty look.\\n\\nANAKIN: (continuing) No offense, my Master, but I\\'m only stating a fact.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Oh no, you\\'re quite right, but I do have the most experience with his ways of combat.\\n\\nYODA: Obi-Wan, my choice is.\\n\\nKl-ADI-MUNDI: I concur. Master Kenobi should go.\\n\\nYODA: I agree.\\n\\nAll the JEDI concur.\\n\\nMACE: Very well. Council is adjourned.\\n\\nANAKIN is angry.\\n\\nMACE: (continuing) Obi-Wan, prepare two clone brigades as quickly as you can. If this report is true, there\\'s no telling how many battle droids he may have with him.\\n\\n91 INT. KASHYYYK-HOLOGRAM AREA-DAY\\n\\nYODA gets out of his chair and walks to the edge of the platform.\\n\\nCLONE COMMANDER GREE: The droids have started up their main power generators.\\n\\nYODA: Then now the time is, Commander.\\n\\nCLONE COMMANDER GREE: Yes, sir.\\n\\nThe battle begins.\\n\\n92 EXT. KASHYYYK-BEACH HEAD-DAY\\n\\nA WOOKIEE CHIEFTAIN lets out a roar as the Wookiee army rushes to face the DROID ARMY. CORPORATE ALLIANCE TANK DROIDS race across the water against the WOOKIEES and CLONE TROOPERS on the beach. DROID GUNSHIPS provide air support, while a SPIDER DROID emerges from the watery depths. A brave WOOKIEE places an explosive on a SEPARATIST TANK and jumps off just before the TANK EXPLODES. From the Hologram Area, Yoda observes the ongoing battle.\\n\\n93 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME\\'S APARTMENT-EARLY MORNING\\n\\nPadme\\'s apartment building is surrounded by the smog-shrouded city of Coruscant.\\n\\n94 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME\\'S APARTMENT-LIVING ROOM-EARLY MORNING\\n\\nPADME and OBI-WAN sit on one of the couches.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Has Anakin been to see you?\\n\\nPADME: Several times . . . I was so happy to hear he was accepted on the Jedi Council.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I know ... he deserves it. He is impatient, strong willed, very opinionated, but truly gifted.\\n\\nThey laugh.\\n\\nPADME: You\\'re not just here to say hello. Something is wrong, isn\\'t it?\\n\\nOBI-WAN: You should be a Jedi, Padme.\\n\\nPADME: You\\'re not very good at hiding your feelings.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: It\\'s Anakin . . . He\\'s becoming moody and detached. He\\'s been put in a difficult position as the Chancellor\\'s representative . . . but I think it\\'s more than that. I was hoping he may have talked to you.\\n\\nPADME: Why would he talk to me about his work?\\n\\nOBI-WAN studies her.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Neither of you is very good at hiding your feelings either.\\n\\nPADME: Don\\'t give me that look.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I know how he feels about you.\\n\\nPADME: (nervous) What did he say?\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Nothing. He didn\\'t have to.\\n\\nPADME is a little flustered. She stands and Obi-Wan follows. She walks to the balcony.\\n\\nPADME: I don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I know you both too well. I can see you two are in love. Padme, I\\'m worried about him.\\n\\nPADME looks down and doesn\\'t answer.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) I fear your relationship has confused him. He\\'s changed considerably since we returned . . .\\n\\nThey stand on the balcony and look off at the early morning city. OBI-WAN starts to leave. PADME stays looking off into the distant city.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) Padme, I\\'m not telling the Council about any of this. I ... I hope I didn\\'t upset you. We\\'re all friends, I care about both of you . . .\\n\\nPADME: Thank you, Obi-Wan.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Please do what you can to help him.\\n\\n95 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME\\'S APARTMENT-DAY\\n\\nPADME, MON MOTHMA, and five other Senators (BANA BREEMU, FANG ZAR. CHI EEKWAY, GIDDEAN DANU, BAIL ORGANA) sit in Padme\\'s living room. C-3PO serves drinks to the guests.\\n\\nPADME: We cannot let this turn into another war.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: Absolutely, that is the last thing we want.\\n\\nMON MOTHMA: We are hoping to form an alliance in the Senate to stop the Chancellor from further subverting the constitution, that\\'s all.\\n\\nPADME: I know a Jedi I feel it would be wise to consult.\\n\\nBANA BREEMU: That would be dangerous.\\n\\nMON MOTHMA: We don\\'t know where the Jedi stand in all this.\\n\\nPADME: I only wish to discuss this with one . . . one I trust.\\n\\nGiDDEAN DANU: Going against the Chancellor without the support of the Jedi is risky.\\n\\nPADME: The Jedi aren\\'t any happier with the situation than we are . . .\\n\\nCHI EEKWAY: Patience, Senator.\\n\\nFANG ZAR: We have so many Senators on our side, surely that will pursuade the Chancellor.\\n\\nBANA BREEMU: When you present the \"petition of the two thousand\" to the Chancellor, things may change.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: Let us see what we can accomplish in the Senate, before we include the Jedi.\\n\\nPADME takes a deep breath in frustration and disappointment.\\n\\n96 EXT. CORUSCANT-CLONE LANDING PLATFORM-DAY\\n\\nANAKIN and OBI-WAN walk onto a landing platform overlooking a docking bay where THOUSANDS OF CLONE TROOPS and armored weapons, tanks, etc., are being loaded onto a massive REPUBLIC ASSAULT SHIP.\\n\\nANAKIN: You\\'re going to need me on this one, Master.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Oh, I agree. However it may turn out just to be a wild bantha chase.\\n\\nOBI-WAN starts to turn and leave.\\n\\nANAKIN: Master!\\n\\nOBI-WAN stops and ANAKIN walks over to him.\\n\\nANAKIN: (continuing) Master, I\\'ve disappointed you. I have not been very appreciative of your training . . . I have been arrogant and I apologize . . . I\\'ve just been so frustrated with the Council. Your friendship means everything to me.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: You are strong and wise, Anakin, and I am very proud of you. I have trained you since you were a small boy. I have taught you everything I know. And you have become a far greater Jedi than I could ever hope to be, and you have saved my life more times than I can remember. But be patient, Anakin. It won\\'t be long before the Council makes you a Jedi Master.\\n\\nOBI-WAN starts down the ramp, then turns back.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) Don\\'t worry. I have enough clones with me to take three systems the size of Utapau. I think I\\'ll be able to handle the situation . . . even without your help.\\n\\nANAKIN: Well, there\\'s always a first time.\\n\\nOBI-WAN laughs.\\n\\nThey talk for a few more minutes before ANAKIN watches OBI-WAN depart.\\n\\nANAKIN: Obi-Wan, may the Force be with you.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Good-bye, old friend. May the Force be with you.\\n\\nOBI-WAN heads down a ramp toward the waiting Republic cruiser.\\n\\n97 EXT. CORUSCANT-CLONE LANDING PLATFORM-DAY\\n\\nThe Republic cruiser lifts off and heads for space.\\n\\n98 INT. REPUBLIC BATTLE CRUISER-HANGAR-SPACE\\n\\nCLONE TROOPERS stand at attention in rows on the floor of the hangar deck, waiting to board landing craft. OBI-WAN stands next to his BLUE JEDI FIGHTER- talking to SEVERAL CLONE COMMANDERS with their helmets off. A hologram of the planet Utapau is projected by R4-G9 into the middle of the hangar.\\n\\nCLONE COMMANDER CODY: Fortunately, most of the cities are concentrated on this small continent here . . . on the far side.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I\\'ll keep them distracted until you get there. Just don\\'t take too long.\\n\\nCLONE COMMANDER CODY: Come on, boss, when have I ever let you down?\\n\\nThey laugh.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: (laughing) Cato Nemoidia . . . for starters.\\n\\nOBI-WAN climbs into his Jedi Fighter.\\n\\nCLONE COMMANDER CODY: That was Anakin who was late. I believe.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Very well, the burden is on me not to destroy all the droids before you get there.\\n\\nCLONE COMMANDER CODY: I\\'m counting on you.\\n\\n99 EXT. JEDI FIGHTER-SPACE\\n\\nOBI-WAN blasts the BLUE JEDI FIGHTER out of the Republic Battle Cruiser and into the hyperspace ring. He heads for the planet Utapau.\\n\\n100 EXT. CORUSCANT-CITYSCAPE-CHANCELLOR\\'S TRANSPORT-DAY\\n\\nThe Chancellor\\'s Transport races through the city and heads for the Senate Office Building landing platform. Waiting on the landing platform is a LONE JEDI. The Transport lands, and CHANCELLOR PALPATINE emerges with FOUR ROYAL GUARDS and MAS AMEDDA. The FOUR ROYAL GUARDS move off in another direction as PALPATINE greets ANAKIN, who has been waiting for him.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Well, Anakin, did you see your friend off?\\n\\nANAKIN: He will soon have Grievous\\'s head.\\n\\nPALPATINE: We can only hope the Council didn\\'t make a mistake.\\n\\nANAKIN: The Council was very sure in its decision.\\n\\nThey exit the landing platform.\\n\\n101 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-MAIN HALLWAY-DAY\\n\\nThey enter the main hallway of the Senate Office Building. They pass SEVERAL SENATORS, including REPRESENTATIVE JAR JAR BINKS from Naboo.\\n\\nJAR JAR: Helloo Annie. Good en to see yousa . . .\\n\\nThe Gungan waves to Anakin.\\n\\nANAKIN: Hi, Jar Jar.\\n\\nJAR JAR: Oopsin da Chancellor!! So sorry, Your Highness, sir.\\n\\nAnakin turns back to the Chancellor.\\n\\nPALPATINE: There are rumors in the Senate about Master Kenobi. Many believe he is not fit for this assignment.\\n\\nANAKIN: Not fit? Why would anyone think that?\\n\\nPALPATINE: They say his mind has become fogged by the influence of a certain female Senator.\\n\\nANAKIN: That\\'s ridiculous. Who?!?\\n\\nPALPATINE: (slyly) No one knows who she is ... only that she is a Senator.\\n\\nANAKIN: That\\'s impossible. I would know.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Sometimes the closest are the ones who cannot see.\\n\\nANAKIN becomes worried.\\n\\nPALPATINE: (continuing) Idle Senate gossip is rarely true and never accurate. I\\'m sure your Master will do fine.\\n\\n102 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-DREAM\\n\\nPADME calls out in pain. OBI-WAN is near her and softly speaks to her.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Save your energy.\\n\\nPADME: I can\\'t!\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Don\\'t give up, Padme. Don\\'t give up . . .\\n\\n103 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME\\'S APARTMENT-LANDING ROOM-DAY\\n\\nANAKIN is in the living room, working. He sits on the couch where Obi-Wan was sitting. PADME enters and crosses behind him.\\n\\nANAKIN: I sense someone familiar . . . Obi-Wan\\'s been here, hasn\\'t he?\\n\\nPADME: He came by this morning.\\n\\nANAKIN: What did he want?\\n\\nPADME looks at him for a moment. ANAKIN seems tense.\\n\\nPADME: He\\'s worried about you.\\n\\nANAKIN: You told him about us, didn\\'t you?\\n\\nShe continues to walk to the bedroom, he follows.\\n\\nPADME: He\\'s your best friend, Anakin. He says you\\'re under a lot of stress.\\n\\nANAKIN: And he\\'s not?\\n\\nPADME: You have been moody lately.\\n\\nANAKIN: I\\'m not moody . . .\\n\\nPADME: Anakin! Don\\'t do this again.\\n\\nANAKIN: I don\\'t know ... I feel . . . lost.\\n\\nPADME: Lost? What do you mean? You\\'re always so sure of yourself. I don\\'t understand.\\n\\nANAKIN: Obi-Wan and the Council don\\'t trust me.\\n\\nPADME: They trust you with their lives. Obi-Wan loves you as a son.\\n\\nANAKIN: Something\\'s happening . . . I\\'m not the Jedi I should be. I am one of the most powerful Jedi, but I\\'m not satisfied ... I want more, and I know I shouldn\\'t.\\n\\nPADME: You expect too much of yourself.\\n\\nThey stop in front of the window in the bedroom. ANAKIN puts his hand on her belly.\\n\\nANAKIN: I have found a way to save you.\\n\\nPADME: Save me?\\n\\nANAKIN: From my nightmares.\\n\\nPADME: Is that what\\'s bothering you?\\n\\nANAKIN: I won\\'t lose you, Padme.\\n\\nPADME: I\\'m not going to die in childbirth, Annie. I promise you.\\n\\nANAKIN: No, I promise you! I am becoming so powerful with my new knowledge of the Force, I will be able to keep you from dying.\\n\\nPADME looks ANAKIN in the eye.\\n\\nPADME: You don\\'t need more power, Anakin. I believe you can protect me against anything, just as you are.\\n\\nThey embrace and kiss.\\n\\n104 EXT. UTAPAU-SPACE\\n\\nOBI-WAN blasts out of the BLUE JEDI FIGHTER\\'s hyperspace ring and heads for the planet Utapau. The BLUE FIGHTER skims over the planet\\'s surface, flat except for a few giant sinkholes.\\n\\n105 INT. UTAPAU-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY\\n\\nOBI-WAN lands his ship on a Platform projecting out of the side of a giant sinkhole. All is quiet. A local administrator, TION MEDON, comes out to greet the ship. OBI-WAN climbs out of his Fighter as a SHORT GROUND CREW looks over his ship. On a ledge above the landing platform, GRIEVOUS\\'s BODYGUARDS watch as OBI-WAN talks to TION MEDON.\\n\\nTlON MEDON: Greetings, young Jedi. What brings you to our remote sanctuary?\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Unfortunately, the war.\\n\\nTlON MEDON: There is no war here unless you\\'ve brought it with you.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: With your kind permission, I should like some fuel and to use your city as a base as I search nearby systems for General Grievous.\\n\\nA GROUND CREW rushes out and refuels Obi-Wan s Fighter. TION MEDON leans close to OBI-WAN and speaks quietly.\\n\\nTlON MEDON: He is here! We are being held hostage. They are watching us.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I understand.\\n\\nTlON MEDON: The tenth level . . . thousands of Battle Droids . . .\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Tell your people to take shelter. If you have warriors, now is the time.\\n\\nOBI-WAN starts back toward his Starfighter as TION MEDON leaves the Landing Platform. GRIEVOUS\\'s BODYGUARDS retreat from the overhead platform. OBI-WAN climbs back into his BLUE JEDI FIGHTER. His Astro Unit (R4-G9) turns to him:\\n\\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) Geenine, take the Fighter back to the ship. I\\'m staying here. Tell Cody I\\'ve made contact.\\n\\nThe little Astro Droid BEEPS a reply.\\n\\n106 EXT. UTAPAU-OBSERVATION DECK-DAY\\n\\nOn a high balcony, TION MEDON looks down on the landing platform. A few steps behind him stands one of GENERAL GRIEVOUS\\'s BODYGUARDS. They watch the canopy lower.\\n\\nTlON MEDON: I told you, all he wanted was fuel.\\n\\nBODYGUARD: What was his name?\\n\\nTlON MEDON: He didn\\'t say.\\n\\nThey watch as the BLUE JEDI FIGHTER takes off.\\n\\n107 INT. UTAPAU-LANDING PLATFORM-HALLWAY-DAY\\n\\nOBI-WAN also watches his ship take off. He is hiding in the hallway. He quietly moves farther into the city.\\n\\n108 EXT. UTAPAU STAIRWAY-SINKHOLE RIM-DAY\\n\\nOBI-WAN quickly rushes up a stairway cut into the side of the sinkhole. It\\'s hard to see him. In an alcove, he carefully surveys the city, then quickly moves on.\\n\\n109 INT. UTAPAU-CITY-DRAGON CORRAL-DAY\\n\\nOBI-WAN makes his way through the city, looking up at the tenth level with electro-binoculars from his utility belt. He tries to figure out how he is going to get up there. He hears strange bellowing cries and he investigates.\\nHe comes across a corral filled with about half a dozen DRAGON-LIKE LIZARDS. SEVERAL WRANGLERS are standing around.\\nOBI-WAN walks up to the WRANGLERS and uses the Force with his slight hand movements.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I need transportation.\\n\\nWRANGLER: (subtitled, in native tongue) You need transportation.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Get it for me.\\n\\nWRANGLER: (subtitled, in native tongue) I will get it for you.\\n\\nOne of the WRANGLERS turns to the others and chatters away in his strange tongue. OBI-WAN walks along the line of DRAGON/LIZARDS, checking out each one. He looks at their teeth, legs, etc. Finally he pats one on the neck.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: This one.\\n\\nThe WRANGLER brings the chosen one over to him.\\n\\nWRANGLER: Boga. She answers to Boga.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Good girl, Boga.\\n\\nOBI-WAN swings onto the back of the LIZARD. The beast rears up and scurries outside to the edge of the sinkhole.\\n\\n110 EXT. UTAPAU-SINKHOLE WALL-LIZARD-DAY\\n\\nThe LIZARD BOGA rears up on her hind legs again, then climbs the wall of the sheer cliff and starts moving up toward the tenth level. The city appears to be deserted. OBI-WAN is alert to any movement.\\n\\n111 INT. UTAPAU-CONFERENCE ROOM-GRAND CHAMBER-DAY\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS stands before the COUNCIL OF SEPARATISTS, including NUTE GUNRAY, RUNE HAAKO. POGGLE THE LESSER, SHU MAI, SAN HILL PO NUDO, WAT TAMBOR, and PASSEL ARGENTE. OBI-WAN hides above the assembly and watches intently.\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: It won\\'t be long before the armies of the Republic track us here. I am sending you to the Mustafar system in the Outer Rim. It is a volcanic planet which generates a great deal of scanning interference. You will be safe there.\\n\\nNUTE GUNRAY: Safe? Chancellor Palpatine managed to escape your grip, General, without Count Dooku. I have doubts about your ability to keep us safe.\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Be thankful, Viceroy, you have not found yourself in my grip . . . Your ship is waiting.\\n\\nOBI-WAN is deep in thought.\\n\\n112 INT. UTAPAU-TENTH LEVEL-CONTROL CENTER-DAY\\n\\nThe JEDI removes his cloak and jumps down behind the GENERAL.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Hello, there!\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: General Kenobi, you are a bold one. I find your behavior bewildering . . . Surely you realize you\\'re doomed, (to droids) Kill him!\\n\\nAbout a HUNDRED BATTLE DROIDS surround OBI-WAN, GENERAL GRIEVOUS, and his BODYGUARDS. OBI-WAN looks around, then walks right up to GENERAL GRIEVOUS.\\nThey stare at each other for a moment.\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Enough of this.\\n\\nThe BODYGUARDS raise their power staffs to knock OBI-WAN away, but OBI-WAN ducks as the deadly staffs whistle over his head. The Jedi\\'s lightsaber ignites, and OBI-WAN deftly cuts one BODYGUARD in two. His staff flies into the air and is caught by GENERAL GRIEVOUS. The other THREE BODYGUARDS attack OBI-WAN with an intense fury.\\nOBI-WAN uses the Force to release apiece of equipment from the ceiling. It drops on the BODYGUARDS, smashing them. OBI-WAN walks toward GRIEVOUS, slashing the last BODYGUARD to pieces. BATTLE DROIDS move toward OBI-WAN.\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Back away. I will deal with this Jedi slime myself.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Your move.\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: You fool. I have been trained in your Jedi arts by Count Dooku himself. Attack, Kenobi.\\n\\nHis arms separate and grab all four lightsabers on his belt. His four arms create a flashing display of swordsmanship.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: You forget I trained the Jedi that defeated Count Dooku!\\n\\nOBI-WAN is hard-pressed to defend himself against the deadly onslaught. They fight across the control room as the BATTLE DROID SHARPSHOOTERS try to pick off the Jedi. OBI-WAN mounts a ferocious counterattack and cuts off one of GRIEVOUS\\'s hands. A loud EXPLOSION is heard echoing throughout the sinkhole. GENERAL GRIEVOUS and OBI-WAN glance to the entrance of the control center and see CLONE TROOPS in the distance, attacking DROIDS in the sinkhole. On the far wall of the sinkhole, CLONES can be seen rappelling onto balconies.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I may not defeat your droids, but my troops certainly will.\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Army or not, you must realize you are doomed.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I don\\'t think so.\\n\\nTWENTY CLONES suddenly rappel into the entrance of the control center, ray guns blazing. Chaos. Laser bolts fly everywhere as the DROIDS return fire. OBI-WAN attacks GENERAL GRIEVOUS, who defends himself rigorously with one of his bodyguard\\'s electro-staffs. OBI-WAN uses the Force to hurl GENERAL GRIEVOUS backwards. He falls onto a lower platform and OBI-WAN jumps down after him.\\n\\n113 INT. UTAPAU-TENTH LEVEL-CONTROL CENTER-DAY\\n\\nMore CLONES rappel into the control center and blast away at the remaining DROIDS.\\nThe JEDI cuts down several DROIDS as he races to the entrance of the control center. OBI-WAN spots GENERAL GRIEVOUS racing toward one of the landing platforms in the midst of the battle. GENERAL GRIEVOUS jumps onto a WHEEL SCOOTER and takes off down the wall of the sinkhole. OBI-WAN whistles for his LIZARD BOGA, who runs to him. OBI-WAN jumps on.\\n\\n114 EXT. UTAPAU-CLIFF AND LANDING PLATFORM-DAY\\n\\nThe chase begins. Obi-Wan drops his lightsaber while riding Boga.\\n\\n115 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-SUNSET\\n\\nThe sun is setting as the lights come on in the massive Senate Office Building. The sky is red.\\n\\n116 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR\\'S OFFICE-SUNSET\\n\\nPALPATINE listens to a delegation from the Senate, which includes PADME and five other Senators: NEE ALAVAR, FANG ZAR, MALEDEE, SWEITT CONCORKILL, and MON CALAMARI. ANAKIN stands to one side of PALPATINE.\\n\\nPALPATINE: I understand your reservations completely, Senator, and I assure you the appointment of Governors will in no way compete with the duties of the Senate.\\n\\nPADME: May I take it then, that there will be no further amendments to the Constitution?\\n\\nPALPATINE: I want this terrible conflict to end as much as you do, My Lady, and when it does I guarantee an immediate return to democracy . . .\\n\\nPADME: You are pursuing a diplomatic solution to the war, then.\\n\\nPALPATINE: You must trust me to do the right things, Senator. That is why I am here.\\n\\nFANGZAR: But surely . . .\\n\\nThe Chancellor turns on FANG ZAR.\\n\\nPALPATINE: I have said I will do what is right, that should be enough for your . . . committee.\\n\\nPADME: On behalf of the \"delegation of two thousand,\" I thank you, Chancellor.\\n\\nPALPATINE: I thank you for bringing this to my attention, Senator.\\n\\nPADME gives ANAKIN a frustrated look, then turns and exits with the other FIVE SENATORS. PALPATINE turns to ANAKIN.\\n\\nPALPATINE: (continuing) Their sincerity is to be admired, although I sense there is more to their request than they are telling us.\\n\\nANAKIN: What do you mean?\\n\\nPALPATINE: They are not to be trusted.\\n\\nANAKIN: Surely Senator Amidala can be trusted . . .\\n\\nPALPATINE: These are unstable times for the Republic, Anakin. Some see instability as an opportunity. Senator Amidala is hiding something. I can see it in her eyes.\\n\\nANAKIN: I\\'m sure you\\'re mistaken.\\n\\nPALPATINE: I\\'m surprised your Jedi insights are not more sensitive to such things.\\n\\nANAKIN: I simply don\\'t sense betrayal in Senator Amidala.\\n\\nPALPATINE studies ANAKIN carefully and gives him a skeptical look.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Yes, you do, but you don\\'t seem to want to admit it. There is much conflict in you, Anakin.\\n\\n117 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI WAR ROOM-EARLY EVENING\\n\\nKI-ADI-MUNDI, ANAKIN, YODA, MACE, CLONE COMMANDER CODY, and AAYLA SECURA talk via holograms.\\n\\nCLONE COMMANDER CODY: Master Windu, may I interrupt? General Kenobi has made contact with General Grievous, and we\\nhave begun our attack.\\n\\nMACE WlNDU: Thank you, Commander. Anakin, deliver this report to the Chancellor. His reaction will give us a clue to his\\nintentions.\\n\\nANAKIN: Yes, Master.\\n\\nANAKIN leaves the room. COMMANDER CODY\\'s hologram disappears.\\n\\nMACE WINDU: I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi. The dark side of the Force surrounds the Chancellor.\\n\\nKl-ADI-MUNDI: If he does not give up his emergency powers after the destruction of Grievous, then he should be removed from\\noffice.\\n\\nMACE WiNDU: That could be a dangerous move ... the Jedi Council would have to take control of the Senate in order to secure a peaceful transition . . .\\n\\nKl-ADI-MUNDI: . . . and replace the Congress with Senators who are not filled with greed and corruption.\\n\\nYODA: To a dark place this line of thought will carry us. Hmmmmm. . . . great care we must take.\\n\\n118 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR\\'S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING\\n\\nANAKIN brings news to PALPATINE.\\n\\nANAKIN: Chancellor, we have just received a report from Master Kenobi. He has engaged General Grievous.\\n\\nPALPATINE: We can only hope that Master Kenobi is up to the challenge.\\n\\nANAKIN: I should be there with him.\\n\\nPALPATINE: It is upsetting to me to see that the Council doesn\\'t seem to fully appreciate your talents. Don\\'t you wonder why they won\\'t make you a Jedi Master?\\n\\nANAKIN: I wish I knew. More and more I get the feeling that I am being excluded from the Council. I know there are things about the Force that they are not telling me.\\n\\nPALPATINE: They don\\'t trust you, Anakin. They see your future. They know your power will be too strong to control. Anakin, you must break through the fog of lies the Jedi have created around you. Let me help you to know the subtleties of the Force.\\n\\nThey walk into the hallway.\\n\\nANAKIN: How do you know the ways of the Force?\\n\\nPALPATINE: My mentor taught me everything about the Force . . . even the nature of the dark side.\\n\\nThey stop.\\n\\nANAKIN: You know the dark side?!?\\n\\nPALPATINE: Anakin, if one is to understand the great mystery, one must study all its aspects, not just the dogmatic, narrow view of the Jedi. If you wish to become a complete and wise leader, you must embrace a larger view of the Force. Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin. (pausing) They fear you. In time they will destroy you. Let me train you.\\n\\nANAKIN: I won\\'t be a pawn in your political game. The Jedi are my family.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Only through me can you achieve a power greater than any Jedi. Learn to know the dark side of the Force, Anakin, and you will be able to save your wife from certain death.\\n\\nANAKIN: What did you say?\\n\\nPALPATINE: Use my knowledge, I beg you . . .\\n\\nANAKIN: You\\'re a Sith Lord!\\n\\nANAKIN ignites his lightsaber.\\n\\nPALPATINE: I know what has been troubling you . . . Listen to me. Don\\'t continue to be a pawn of the Jedi Council! Ever since I\\'ve known you, you\\'ve been searching for a life greater than that of an ordinary Jedi . . . a life of significance, of conscience.\\n\\nANAKIN: You\\'re wrong!\\n\\nPALPATINE: Are you going to kill me?\\n\\nANAKIN: I would certainly like to.\\n\\nPALPATINE: I know you would. I can feel your anger. It gives you focus, makes you stronger.\\n\\nANAKIN raises his lightsaber to PALPATINE\\'s throat. There is a tense moment, then ANAKIN relaxes, and then turns off his lightsaber.\\n\\nANAKIN: I am going to turn you over to the Jedi Council.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Of course you should. But you\\'re not sure of their intentions, are you? What if I am right and they are plotting to take over the Republic?\\n\\nANAKIN: I will quickly discover the truth of all this.\\n\\nPALPATINE: You have great wisdom, Anakin. Know the power of the dark side. The power to save Padme.\\n\\nANAKIN stares at him for a moment.\\nPALPATINE turns and moves to his office.\\n\\nPALPATINE: (continuing) I am not going anywhere. You have time to decide my fate. Perhaps you\\'ll reconsider and help me rule the galaxy for the good of all . . .\\n\\nPALPATINE sits behind his desk.\\n\\n119 EXT. UTAPAU-CLIFF AND LANDING PLATFORM-DAY\\n\\nOBI-WAN gives the LIZARD a swift kick with the heel of his boot, and they take off down the vertical side of the sheer cliff. As GENERAL GRIEVOUS reaches the landing platform where his shuttle is waiting. OBI-WAN drops onto the top of the starship with his LIZARD. GENERAL GRIEVOUS spins his scooter around and takes off up the vertical cliff face with OBI-WAN and his LIZARD in hot pursuit. The sinkhole is engulfed in a great battle between CLONES and DROIDS. The PEOPLE OF UTAPAU cower in whatever shelter they can find.\\n\\n120 EXT. UTAPAU-MAIN CITY PLAZA-DAY\\n\\nA LARGE GROUP OF UTAPAUAN TROOPS on LIZARDS attack the DROID ARMY.\\n\\nOBI-WAN and GENERAL GRIEVOUS race through the city at breakneck speed. Passing through battle zones, narrowly escaping EXPLOSIONS, laser bolts, and TROOPS from both sides.\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS lays the Scooter down as he goes around sharp turns. Obi-Wan\\'s LIZARD breathes hard as she tries to keep up. They destroy droids, equipment, and clone troops as the JEDI and the GENERAL cut a swath of destruction through the city.\\n\\n121 EXT. UTAPAU-WINDMILLS-DAY\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS works his way out onto the rim of the sinkhole, passing some wind blades. The evil Droid General releases the brakes on the lethal blades, and they begin to spin, cutting off Obi-Wan\\'s access to the General. Obi-Wan\\'s LIZARD pulls up short in front of the blades. GENERAL GRIEVOUS laughs and talks into a comlink.\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Prepare to move out of orbit. I will be up in a few moments.\\n\\nOBI-WAN sizes up the situation, looking for a way to get to GENERAL GRIEVOUS.\\n\\nThe GENERAL accelerates off the edge, activating his claws, drops, and clings to another nearby grouping of windmills. Obi-Wan\\'s LIZARD attempts to jump to follow and barely makes it, almost falling into the precipice below.\\n\\n122 INT. UTAPAU-CITY TUNNEL SYSTEM-DAY\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS roars through the stone block tunnel system, riding up on the curved walls as he goes around corners or passes oncoming traffic. OBI-WAN races after the Droid, his LIZARD moving onto the ceiling as they pass traffic. OBI-WAN catches up with GENERAL GRIEVOUS, and they charge through the tunnel, side by side. OBI-WAN grabs the Droid\\'s electronic staff.\\n\\n123 EXT. UTAPAU-SECRET LANDING PLATFORM-DAY\\n\\nExtending from the wall of a small sinkhole is a secret landing platform with a small Federation Fighter sitting in the middle of it. OBI-WAN and GENERAL GRIEVOUS race out of the tunnel system and onto the landing platform.\\n\\nOBI-WAN yanks on the staff, then jumps off his LIZARD onto the General\\'s scooter, knocking both warriors to the ground. GENERAL GRIEVOUS pulls out a laser pistol and fires at OBI-WAN. The Jedi reaches out his hand, grabs the General\\'s electro-staff and spins the staff, blocking the laser bolts.\\n\\nOBI-WAN charges GENERAL GRIEVOUS, swinging the staff and hitting the Droid in the stomach, knocking the gun away. GENERAL GRIEVOUS is hit by the staff, and the Force bends his forearm. He pulls OBI-WAN close to him, and they engage in a furious fight. The electro-staff is knocked away. The two engage in hand-to-hand combat. OBI-WAN struggles to avoid the deadly blows of the brutal, unstoppable Droid.\\n\\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS\\'s stomachplate is loose. OBI-WAN grabs it and rips it off, revealing the alien life form\\'s guts encased in a bag in the Droid\\'s chest. GENERAL GRIEVOUS grabs OBI-WAN, hoists him over his head, and tosses him across the platform. OBI-WAN dangles off the edge of the platform. He clutches the rim, trying to hold on. The DROID then grabs the staff and charges OBI-WAN. At the last second, OBI-WAN reaches out his hand and uses the Force to retrieve the Droid\\'s laser pistol.\\n\\nThe JEDI fires several blasts in the stomach area of the alien Droid, and he EXPLODES from the inside out. The smoldering Droid falls to the ground. OBI-WAN has killed GENERAL GRIEVOUS. He pulls himself up onto the platform and walks by the destroyed carcass.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: So uncivilized . . .\\n\\nOBI-WAN brushes himself off. He throws the pistol onto the platform, picks up the electro-staff, and jumps on BOGA. The trusty beast rears up and takes off into the tunnel system.\\n\\n124 INT. JEDI GUNSHIP-LANDING PLATFORM-EARLY EVENING\\n\\nMACE and the JEDI (AGEN KOLAR, KIT FISTO, AND SAESEE TIIN) are preparing to board a JEDI GUNSHIP to the CHANCELLOR\\'s office. ANAKIN enters the hangar.\\n\\nANAKIN: Master Windu, I must talk to you.\\n\\nMACE WiNDU: What is it, Skywalker? We are in a hurry. We have just received word that Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous. We are on our way to make sure the Chancellor returns emergency powers back to the Senate.\\n\\nANAKIN: He won\\'t give up his power. I\\'ve just learned a terrible truth. I think Chancellor Palpatine is a Sith Lord.\\n\\nMACE WINDU: A Sith Lord?\\n\\nANAKIN: Yes. The one we have been looking for.\\n\\nMACE WiNDU: How do you know this?\\n\\nANAKIN: He knows the ways of the Force. He has been trained to use the dark side.\\n\\nMACE WiNDU: Are you sure?\\n\\nANAKIN: Absolutely.\\n\\nMACE WiNDU: Then our worst fears have been realized. We must move quickly if the Jedi Order is to survive.\\n\\nANAKIN: Master, the Chancellor is very powerful. You will need my help if you are going to arrest him.\\n\\nMACE WiNDU: For your own good, stay out of this affair. I sense a great deal of confusion in you, young Skywalker. There is much fear that clouds your judgment.\\n\\nANAKIN: I must go, Master.\\n\\nMACE WiNDU: No. If what you told me is true, you will have gained my trust, but for now remain here.\\n\\nANAKIN: Yes, Master.\\n\\nMACE WiNDU: Wait for us in the Council Chamber until we return.\\n\\nANAKIN: Yes, Master.\\n\\nANAKIN watches as the JEDI leave in their ship.\\n\\n125 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI COUNCIL/PADME\\'S APARTMENT-EARLY EVENING\\n\\n(INTERCUT)\\n\\nPADME is alone in her apartment, thinking of Anakin. ANAKIN sits alone in the Jedi Council Chamber thinking of PADME.\\n\\nPALPATINE: (V.O.) You do know, don\\'t you, if the Jedi destroy me, any chance of saving her will be lost.\\n\\nPADME: I truly, deeply love you. Before I die. I want you to know.\\n\\nC-3PO: My Lady, are you. . . . Are you all right?\\n\\nANAKIN: I can\\'t do this ... I can\\'t let her die.\\n\\nANAKIN rushes out of the Council Chamber and to his speeder. The hangar door opens and he lifts off.\\n\\n126 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-LANDING PLATFORM-EARLY EVENING\\n\\nThe sky is still blue as a JEDI GUNSHIP lands on the Senate Office Building landing platform.\\nFOUR JEDI exit the SHUTTLE and enter the Senate Office Building. MACE WINDU, AGEN KOLAR, KIT FISTO, and SAESEE TIIN, like gunfighters out of the Old West, walk through the massive hallway, four across.\\n\\n127 INT. CORUSCANT-LOBBY TO CHANCELLOR\\'S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING\\n\\nThe FOUR JEDI enter the lobby, raising their arms, and send the Chancellor\\'s aide, DAR WAC, flying against the wall, along with TWO REPUBLIC GUARDS. They storm into the Chancellor\\'s office.\\n\\n128 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING\\n\\nMACE arrives with THREE JEDI to arrest PALPATINE.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Master Windu. I take it General Grievous has been destroyed then. I must say, you\\'re here sooner than expected.\\n\\nMACE WINDU: In the name of the Galactic Senate of the Republic, you are under arrest, Chancellor.\\n\\nMACE WINDU and the other JEDI ignite their lightsabers.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Are you threatening me, Master Jedi?\\n\\nMACE: The Senate will decide your fate.\\n\\nPALPATINE: (burst of anger) I am the Senate!\\n\\nMACE: Not yet!\\n\\nPALPATINE stands, a laser sword appears out of his cloak sleeve, and he spins toward the JEDI.\\n\\nPALPATINE: It\\'s treason, then.\\n\\nA close shot of PALPATINE as the fight begins. Close shots of THREE JEDI getting cut down by PALPATINE. PALPATINE and MACE continue to fight.\\n\\nJedi Master MACE WINDU and the Sith Lord fight their way down the hallway and into the main office area. PALPATINE is able to use the Force to slam MACE against the wall, but he recovers before the Chancellor can cut him down.\\n\\nANAKIN lands his speeder, jumps out, and runs down a long corridor toward the Chancellor\\'s office.\\n\\nIn the heat of battle, MACE cuts the window behind the Chancellor\\'s desk, and it crashes away. MACE is forced out onto the ledge, which is twenty stories up. They fight over the precipice. ANAKIN arrives to see PALPATINE and MACE fighting.\\n\\nThey stop as MACE forces PALPATINE to drop his sword. PALPATINE and MACE start yelling at each other.\\n\\nMACE WINDU: You are under arrest, My Lord.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Anakin! I told you it would come to this. I was right. The Jedi are taking over.\\n\\nMACE WlNDU: You old fool. The oppression of the Sith will never return. Your plot to regain control of the Republic is over . . . you have lost . . .\\n\\nPALPATINE: No! No! You will die!\\n\\nPALPATINE raises his hands, and lightning bolts shoot out. They are blocked by MACE\\'s lightsaber. PALPATINE is pushed back against the window sill.\\n\\nPALPATINE: He is a traitor, Anakin.\\n\\nMACE WlNDU: He\\'s the traitor. Stop him!\\n\\nPALPATINE: Come to your senses, boy. The Jedi are in revolt. They will betray you, just as they betrayed me.\\n\\nMACE WlNDU: Aarrrrggghhhhh . . .\\n\\nPALPATINE: You are not one of them, Anakin. Don\\'t let him kill me.\\n\\nMACE WlNDU: Aarrrrggghhhhh . . .\\n\\nPALPATINE: I am your pathway to power. I have the power to save the one you love. You must choose. You must stop him.\\n\\nMACE WlNDU: Don\\'t listen to him, Anakin.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Help me! Don\\'t let him kill me. I can\\'t hold on any longer. Ahhhhhhh . . . ahhhhhhh . . . ahhhhhhh . . .\\n\\nMACE pushes PALPATINE out to the edge of the ledge. As the Jedi moves closer, the bolts from Palpatine\\'s hands begin to arch back on him. The Chancellor\\'s face begins to twist and distort. His eyes become yellow as he struggles to intensify his powers.\\n\\nPALPATINE: I can\\'t ... I give up. Help me. I am weak ... I am too weak. Don\\'t kill me. I give up. I\\'m dying. I can\\'t hold on any longer.\\n\\nMACE WlNDU: You Sith disease. I am going to end this once and for all.\\n\\nANAKIN: You can\\'t kill him, Master. He must stand trial.\\n\\nMACE WlNDU: He has too much control of the Senate and the Courts. He is too dangerous to be kept alive.\\n\\nPALPATINE: I\\'m too weak. Don\\'t kill me. Please.\\n\\nANAKIN: It is not the Jedi way . . .\\n\\nMACE raises his sword to kill the CHANCELLOR.\\n\\nANAKIN: (continuing) He must live . . .\\n\\nPALPATINE: Please don\\'t, please don\\'t . . .\\n\\nANAKIN: I need him . . .\\n\\nPALPATINE: Please don\\'t . . .\\n\\nANAKIN: NO!!!\\n\\nJust as MACE is about to slash PALPATINE, ANAKIN steps in and cuts off the Jedi\\'s hand holding the lightsaber.\\n\\nAs MACE stares at ANAKIN in shock, PALPATINE springs to life.\\nThe full force of Palpatine\\'s powerful Bolts blasts MACE. He attempts to deflect them with his one good hand, but the force is too great. As blue rays engulf his body, he is flung out the window and falls twenty stories to his death. No more screams. No more moans. PALPATINE lowers his arm.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Power! Unlimited power!\\n\\nHis face has changed into a horrible mask of evil. ANAKIN looks on in horror. PALPATINE cackles.\\n\\nANAKIN: What have I done?\\n\\nANAKIN sits.\\n\\nPALPATINE: You are fulfilling your destin, Anakin. Become my apprentice. Learn to use the dark side of the Force.\\n\\nANAKIN: I will do whatever you ask.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Good.\\n\\nANAKIN: Just help me save Padme\\'s life. I can\\'t live without her. I won\\'t let her die. I want the power to stop death.\\n\\nPALPATINE: To cheat death is a power only one has achieved, but if we work together, I know we can discover the secret.\\n\\nANAKIN kneels before PALPATINE.\\n\\nANAKIN: I pledge myself to your teachings. To the ways of the Sith.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Good. Good. The Force is strong with you. A powerful Sith you will become. Henceforth, you shall be known as Darth . . . Vader.\\n\\nANAKIN: Thank you. my Master.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Rise, Darth Vader.\\n\\nPalpatine moves over to his desk.\\n\\n129 EXT. KASHYYYK-MEETING HALL-DAY\\n\\nYODA winces, closes his eyes, and holds his head. He feels a disturbance in the Force.\\n\\n130 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR\\'S OFFICE-EVENING\\n\\nPALPATINE is putting on his dark cloak: he is now fully DARTH SIDIOUS.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Because the Council did not trust you, my young apprentice, I believe you are the only Jedi with no knowledge of this plot. When the Jedi learn what has transpired here, they will kill us, along with all the Senators.\\n\\nANAKIN: I agree. The Jedi\\'s next move will be against the Senate.\\n\\nPALPATINE: Every single Jedi, including your friend Obi-Wan Kenobi, is now an enemy of the Republic. You understand that, don\\'t you?\\n\\nANAKIN: I understand, Master.\\n\\nPALPATINE: We must move quickly. The Jedi are relentless; if they are not all destroyed, it will be civil war without end. First, I want you to go to the Jedi Temple. We will catch them off balance. Do what must be done, Lord Vader. Do not hesitate. Show no mercy. Only then will you be strong enough with the dark side to save Padme.\\n\\nANAKIN: What about the other Jedi spread across the galaxy?\\n\\nPALPATINE: Their betrayal will be dealt with. After you have killed all the Jedi in the Temple, go to the Mustafar system. Wipe out Viceroy Gunray and the other Separatist leaders. Once more, the Sith will rule the galaxy, and we shall have peace.\\n\\n131 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE ENTRY-NIGHT\\n\\nANAKIN goes to the Jedi Temple with a battalion of Clone Troopers.\\n\\n132 EXT. UTAPAU-TENTH LEVEL-LANDIXG PLATFORM-DAY\\n\\nThe battle between the CLONES and the DROIDS rages throughout the sinkhole. OBI-WAN rides up to CLONE COMMANDER CODY.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Commander, contact your troops. Tell them to move to the higher levels.\\n\\nCLONE COMMANDER CODY: Very good, sir.\\n\\nCLONE COMMANDER CODY starts to move away, then remembers something and returns to OBI-WAN.\\n\\nCLONE COMMANDER CODY: (continuing) Oh, by the way, I think you\\'ll be needing this.\\n\\nHe hands OBI-WAN his lightsaber, and the LIZARD rears up.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Thank you, Cody, (smiling) Now let\\'s get a move on. We\\'ve got a battle to win here.\\n\\nCLONE COMMANDER CODY: Yes, sir!\\n\\nOBI-WAN and the LIZARD ride off down the wall of the giant sinkhole.\\nThe battle rages throughout the city. CLONE COMMANDER CODY (2224,) takes out his comlink and listens to the HOLOGRAM OF DARTH SIDIOUS as, far below, OBI-WAN can been seen battling DROIDS on a landing platform.\\n\\nDARTH SlDIOUS: Commander Cody, the time has come. Execute Order Sixty-Six.\\n\\nCLONE COMMANDER CODY: It will be done, My Lord.\\n\\nThe HOLOGRAM disappears, and CLONE COMMANDER CODY gestures to a nearby Clone Trooper.\\n\\nCLONE COMMANDER CODY: Blast him!\\n\\nThe battle rages all around OBI-WAN. DROIDS and CLONES are everywhere. OBI-WAN is riding on a LIZARD, cutting down DROIDS as he races across the battlefield. Suddenly a volley of laser blasts from behind him knocks him and his LIZARD off the wall of the sinkhole. He looks around just in time to see his CLONE TROOPS are firing on him.\\nOBI-WAN falls hundreds of feet to the bottom of the water-filled sinkhole.\\n\\n133 EXT. MYGEETO-DAWN\\n\\nThe sky slowly awakens on the crystal world of Mygeeto. A battle rages. Clone troops battle the droid armies across a long bridge. KI-ADI-MUNDi uses his light saber to deflect enemy fire. CLONE COMMANDER BACARA (1138) exits a Gunship near the entrance to the city. He rallies his TROOPS to attack the city, then gets a message on his comlink. He stops and moves to one side as a HOLOGRAM OF DARTH SIDIOUS appears on the comlink in the palm of his hand. He moves further into the shadows.\\n\\nDARTH SlDIOUS: Commander 1138 . . .\\n\\nCLONE COMMANDER BACARA: Yes, sir.\\n\\nDARTH SlDIOUS: The time has come. Execute Order Sixty-Six.\\n\\nCLONE COMMANDER BACARA: It will be done, My Lord.\\n\\nDARTH SIDIOUS fades, and the CLONE COMMANDER snaps the comlink closed and looks to the main plaza of the city, where KI-ADI-MUNDI is leading the charge. The clones stop. KI-ADI-MUNDI turns around and is blasted by clone fire. He\\'s killed before he can defend himself.\\n\\n134 EXT. FELUCIA-FOREST-DAY\\n\\nA column of CLONE WALKERS marches across the forest floor. The STRANGE CALLS of the alien forest creatures of FELUCIA suddenly stop. The Jedi AAYLA SECURA and her CLONE TROOPS brace for an ambush.\\n\\nAAYLA: Steady. . . . steady . . .\\n\\nThey all look around for signs of the enemy. CLONE COMMANDER BLY moves up behind the Jedi.\\n\\nAAYLA: (continuing) Bly, do you think they\\'re Droids?\\n\\nBLY: No.\\n\\nBLY blasts AAYLA in the back. The OTHER CLONES fire on her as she hits the ground.\\n\\nAnother Jedi, BARRISS OFFEE, is cutting down a patrol of DROIDS when a CLONE WALKING TANK and SEVEN CLONE TROOPERS round a corner and blast the Jedi away.\\n\\n135 EXT. KASHYYYK-MEETING HALL-DAY\\n\\nYODA drops his gimer stick, clutches his chest, and rests against a wall.\\n\\n136 EXT. KASHYYYK-EDGE OF VILIAGE-DAY\\n\\nThe battle appears to be over. WOOKIEES stack destroyed Droids while CLONES assess the damage to their equipment. A Jedi, LUMINARA UNDULI, talks with EIGHT CLONE OFFICERS standing in a circle around her. Suddenly they reveal their hidden pistols and blast her before she can react.\\n\\nThe Jedi QUINLAN VOS is riding on top of a CLONE TURBO TANK. The main cannon of a second tank slowly swings to point right at him and a COUPLE OF CLONES.\\nThe cannon fires, and QUINLAN VOS and the CLONES disappear in a huge EXPLOSION.\\n\\n137 INT. CATO NEIMOIDIA-COCKPIT CLONE FIGHTER-DAY\\n\\nThe CLONE PILOT watches a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS.\\n\\nDARTH SIDIOUS: Execute Order Sixty-Six.\\n\\nCLONE PILOT: It will be done, My Lord.\\n\\n138 INT. CATO NEIMOIDIA-JEDI STARFIGHTER-DAY\\n\\nPLO KOON heads his ship toward a battle on a landing platform.\\n\\nPLO KOON: There they are. Land on the nearest platform.\\n\\n139 EXT. CATO XEIMOIDIA-JEDI STARFIGHTER-DAY\\n\\nThe FOUR CLONE PILOTS with PLO KOON drop back and blast him out of the sky.\\n\\n140 EXT. SALEUCAMI-FOREST\\n\\nThree Speeder Bikes race through the forest. A Jedi, STASS ALLIE is in the lead. The TWO CLONES following her drop back and blast her, causing her to crash in a huge EXPLOSION.\\n\\n141 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR\\'S OFFICE-NIGHT\\n\\nDARTH SIDIOUS stands alone in his private office, illuminated only from a hologram projector beam from above. A small HOLOGRAM OF COMMANDER GREE stands in front of him.\\n\\nCLONE COMMANDER GREE: Yes, My Lord.\\n\\nDABTH SIDIOUS: The time has come. Execute Order Sixty-Six.\\n\\n142 EXT. KASHYYYK-MEETING HALL BALCONY-DAY\\n\\nA vista of waterways, high green mesas, and giant tree cities serves as a backdrop for the fierce battle, CLONES AND WOOKIEES against TRADE FEDERATION DROID ARMIES, with treaded tank-like vehicles. CLONE COMMANDER GREE holds his comlink.\\n\\nCLONE COMMANDER GREE: It will be done, My Lord.\\n\\nCLONE COMMANDER GREE snaps his comlink shut.\\n\\nYODA watches from the balcony. The battle rages as CLONES and WOOKIEES attack DROIDS coming across the water on CORPORATE ALLIANCE TANK DROIDS. CHEWBACCA and TARFFUL stand on either side of the Jedi Master as he watches the battle below. CLONE COMMANDER GREE and ONE OFFICER walk onto the balcony toward YODA. YODA stands looking over the battlefield below. When they are close enough, the CLONES reveal their weapons and fire.\\n\\nBut faster than the CLONES can reveal their weapons, YODA ignites his lightsaber, leaps in the air, and beheads both CLONES. CHEWBACCA and TARFFUL fire their weapons as more CLONES enter the hall. The Wookiees call out to YODA to follow them. CHEWBACCA picks YODA up and carries him away.\\n\\n143 EXT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-NIGHT\\n\\nA JEDI is surrounded and gunned down by CLONE TROOPERS.\\n\\n144 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-NIGHT\\n\\nANAKIN walks through the Jedi Temple, where he finds and kills SHAAK TI.\\nHe exits Shaak Ti\\'s room and enters a hallway, where the battle is taking place.\\n\\n145 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-BATTLE-NIGHT\\n\\nANAKIN enters a room full of YOUNGLINGS huddled in a corner.\\n\\nYOUNGLINGS: Master Skywalker, there are too many of them. What are we going to do?\\n\\nANAKIN looks back at them with a stern expression on his face and ignites his lightsaber.\\n\\n146 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME\\'S APARTMENT-PRE-DAWN\\n\\nC-3PO and PADME look out the apartment window.\\n\\nC-3PO: The Chancellor\\'s office indicated Master Anakin returned to the Jedi Temple. Don\\'t worry, My Lady. I am sure he will be all right.\\n\\nPADME bursts into tears.\\n\\n147 EXT. CORUSCANT-CITYSCAPE-PRE-DAWN\\n\\nThe city planet is covered in a hazy glow. A column of black smoke can be seen rising in the distance. BAIL ORGANA\\'s Speeder flies overhead, straight toward the smoke.\\n\\n148 EXT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-LANDING PLATFORM-PRE-DAWN\\n\\nThe Jedi Temple is on fire. Large plumes of smoke billow toward the sky as BAIL ORGANA lands his Speeder on a Jedi Temple platform. FOUR CLONE TROOPERS stand guard at the entrance to the Temple. They lower their guns as BAIL gets out of his Speeder and walks toward them.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: What\\'s going on here?!?\\n\\nCLONE SERGEANT: There\\'s been a rebellion. Don\\'t worry, sir, the situation is under control.\\n\\nThe CLONES bar the Senator from entering the Temple.\\n\\nCLONE SERGEANT: (continuing) I\\'m sorry, sir. No one is allowed entry.\\n\\nThe CLONES point their guns at BAIL and cock them.\\n\\nCLONE SERGEANT: (continuing) It\\'s time for you to leave, sir.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: And so it is.\\n\\nBAIL reluctantly heads hack toward his Speeder. Suddenly, several SHOTS RING OUT. BAIL turns and sees a ten-year-old Jedi, ZETT JUKASSA, fighting the CLONES. Several more CLONES join in the fight, followed by CLONE COMMANDER APPO (1119), who points at BAIL.\\n\\nCLONE COMMANDER APPO: Get him! Shoot him!\\n\\nSEVERAL CLONES start firing at BAIL. The Senator jumps for cover behind his Speeder, starting the engines and pulling out his laser\\npistol.\\n\\nThe YOUNG JEDI cuts down several CLONES, including APPO, before he is overrun and shot.\\n\\nThe Speeder takes off with BAIL clinging to the side. The CLONES fire at it as it disappears into the cityscape.\\n\\n149 EXT. CORUSCANT-CITYSCAPE-PRE-DAWN\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA struggles to pull himself into the Speeder as it races along through the cityscape. Finally, he climbs in, just as the Speeder is about to hit a building. BAIL steers clear of the building and races away.\\n\\n150 EXT. UTAPAU-UNDERWATER SINKHOLE-DAY\\n\\nThe Jedi dives below the surface amid a barrage of laser fire. He dives deeper under the water, fumbling in his utility belt for a breathing device. He finds it and puts it in his mouth. He swims underwater until the CLONE TROOPS give up and stop filing.\\n\\n151 EXT. UTAPAU-UNDERWATER CAVES-DAY\\n\\nOBI-WAN removes the breathing apparatus after coming up from underwater. He starts to climb the rock wall.\\n\\nOBI-WAN climbs the wall to the second cave just as TWO LITTLE SEEKER DRONES pop out of the water with their searchlights glowing. OBI-WAN presses himself against the wall of the smaller cave as the TWO SEEKER DRONES search the grotto. One of the SEEKERS begins to enter the cave in which OBI-WAN is hiding. OBI-WAN presses further into the wall. The light shines on the opposite wall and moves to the back of the cave, illuminating a huge NOS MONSTER. OBI-WAN holds his breath. The SEEKER is confused for a moment, then the NOS MONSTER lunges at the SMALL DROID and consumes it in one bite.\\n\\nThe NOS MONSTER\\'S lunge takes him past OBI-WAN, out of the cave, and into the water.\\n\\nThe SECOND SEEKER shines its light on the NOS MONSTER as the evil creature tries to grab the LITTLE DRONE. OBI-WAN slinks off toward the back of the cave. He comes upon a nest of BABY NOS MONSTERS. They SCREECH and make horrible sounds. OBI-WAN jumps over them and continues on his way through the tunnel system.\\n\\n152 EXT. KASHYYYK-LAKE ON VILLAGE EDGE-DUSK\\n\\nCLONES in modified one-man AT-ST\\'s and Swamp Speeders flash their searchlights across the gloomy lake. The light of one of the AT-ST\\'s spots something floating in the water. It is what\\'s left of a Wookiee catamaran. The body of a dead Wookiee (TARFFUL) is lying across the stern of the wreckage of the flying boat. There is some movement on the boat. The CLONE SERGEANT on the AT-ST fires a warning shot past the boat.\\n\\nAT-ST CLONE SERGEANT: Everyone out of there!\\n\\nA CRAZY LITTLE CREATURE about two feet high pops its head over the rail. The creature is covered with mud. His long hair is frizzed out in all directions.\\n\\nCREATURE: Wookiee good . . . eat Wookiee. (crazy little laugh)\\n\\nCLONE SERGEANT: Did you find something?\\n\\nCREATURE: It\\'s nothing, nothing. (laughs)\\n\\nCLONE SERGEANT: It\\'s nothing, nothing. All these Wookiees are dead. Move to the east.\\n\\nCLONE TROOPER: Yes, sir.\\n\\nSuddenly, CHEWBACCA climbs up behind the AT-ST CLONE, dripping wet, and throws the CLONE SERGEANT into the water. CHEWIE BARKS.\\n\\nCREATURE: Right you are, Chewbacca. Faster that will be.\\n\\nTARFFUL jumps up in the boat, and the CREATURE takes off his hair. It is Yoda.\\n\\nYODA: Stink, this mud does. A moment to bathe, give me.\\n\\nYODA, covered with mud, jumps into the water. TARFFUL climbs onto the AT-ST with CHEWBACCA. YODA is out of the water and putting his robes back on.\\n\\nYODA: (continuing) Not far, are we, from the emergency ship. Quickly . . .\\n\\nYODA whistles and a large ALIEN FLYING INSECT called CAN-CELL appears. YODA jumps on the insect\\'s back and they take off. The WOOKIEES follow on the AT-ST. The CLONES continue to search the swamp.\\n\\n153 EXT. KASHYYYK-HILLS OVERLOOKING LAKE-DUSK\\n\\nThe AT-ST marches up the hill and stops. The WOOKIEES jump down. YODA lands on CAN-CELL nearby. CHEWBACCA goes to a tree and pulls down one of its branches.\\nThe ground opens up, and a small WOOKIEE ESCAPE POD rises into the field. YODA opens the door of the pod.\\n\\nYODA: Good-bye. Chewbacca and Tarfful, miss you I will. Good friends you are. For your help, much gratitude and respect, I have.\\n\\nThe Wookiees BARK as the Jedi climbs into the WOOKIEE POD and takes off into the dusk sky.\\n\\n154 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-UNDERGROUND STARSHIP LANDING PLATFORM-DAY\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA walks out of a tunnel onto a huge underground platform with two of his AIDES. He is stopped by TWO ROYAL GUARDS.\\n\\nROYAL GUARD: Identification . . .\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan.\\n\\nBAIL and his AIDES hand them their ID cards. The ROYAL GUARDS check them over and give them back, then BAIL and his CREW walk on board his Starship.\\n\\n155 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-UNDERGROUND LANDING PLATFORM-DAY\\n\\nThe platform rises to the surface of the Office Building. The ALDERAAN STARCRUISER takes off and disappears into the crisp morning sky.\\n\\n156 INT ALDERAAN-STARCRUISER-HALLWAY-DAY\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA is greeted by CAPTAIN ANTILLES and TWO ALDERAAN TROOPERS.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: Were you able to get hold of a Jedi homing beacon?\\n\\nCAPTAIN ANTILLES: Yes, sir. We\\'ve encountered no opposition. The clones are still a bit confused. It appears no one is in command.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: That will change soon. Hopefully we will be able to intercept a few Jedi before they walk into this catastrophe.\\n\\n157 EXT. UTAPAU-SINKHOLE WALL-LATE DAY\\n\\nOBI-WAN hides from a group of CLONE TROOPERS.\\n\\nCLONE CAPTAIN: Did you find Kenobi?\\n\\nCLONE TROOPER: No one could have survived that fall.\\n\\nHe watches them pass.\\n\\nCLONE CAPTAIN: Start loading your men on the ship.\\n\\nCLONE TROOPER: Yes, sir.\\n\\nOBI-WAN tries to sneak back to the secret platform, down a flight of stairs.\\n\\n158 EXT. UTAPAU-SECRET LANDING PLATFORM-LATE DAY\\n\\nOBI-WAN makes his way out of the cave and onto General Grievous\\'s secret landing platform. He runs to the Starfighter and climbs into the one-man ship. The Starfighter takes off and disappears into the sky.\\n\\n159 EXT. UTAPAU-SPACE\\n\\nOBI-WAN flies away from the planet Utapau in General Grievous\\'s tiny Starfighter.\\n\\n160 INT. GENERAL GRIEVOUS\\'S STARFIGHTER-SPACE\\n\\nOBI-WAN activates the controls on the Starfighter. He punches in several coordinates and codes. A BEEPING SOUND is heard. It quickly speeds up until it is a steady tone. OBI-WAN speaks into his comlink.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Emergency Code Nine Thirteen ... I have no contact on any frequency. Are there any Jedi out there? . . . anywhere . . .\\n\\nA BURST OF STATIC is heard- and a FUZZY HOLOGRAM image appears.\\n\\nBAIL: (hologram) . . . Kenobi . . .\\n\\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) I\\'ve locked on. Repeat.\\n\\nThe FUZZY HOLOGRAM image comes into focus, and it is BAIL ORGANA.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: Master Kenobi??\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Senator Organa! My Clone Troops turned on me ... I need help.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: We have just rescued Master Yoda. It appears this ambush has happened everywhere. We\\'re sending you our coordinates.\\n\\n161 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME SAPARTMENT-PRE-DAWN\\n\\nPADME stands before the window of her living room, watching the plume of smoke from the Jedi Temple. C-3PO enters from the bedroom.\\n\\nC-3PO: My Lady, there\\'s a Jedi fighter docking on the veranda.\\n\\nPADME turns and rushes to the bedroom.\\n\\n162 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME\\'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-PRE-DAWN\\n\\nTHREEPIO walks out to ANAKIN\\'s ship and talks with ARTOO. ARTOO beeps.\\n\\nTHREEPIO: Hush! Not so loud!\\n\\nPADME rushes onto the veranda as ANAKIN exits his GREEN JEDI FIGHTER. They embrace.\\n\\nPADME: Are you all right? I heard there was an attack on the Jedi Temple . . . you can see the smoke from here.\\n\\nANAKIN: I\\'m fine. I\\'m fine. I came to see if you and the baby are safe.\\n\\nPADME: Captain Typho\\'s here, we\\'re safe. What\\'s happening?\\n\\nC-3PO continues to talk to R2-D2 on the GREEN FIGHTER.\\n\\nC-3PO: What is going on?\\n\\nARTOO SQUEAKS and BEEPS.\\n\\nC-3PO: (continuing) You can\\'t be anymore confused than I am.\\n\\nANAKIN: The situation is not good. The Jedi have tried to overthrow the Republic . . .\\n\\nPADME: I can\\'t believe that!\\n\\nANAKIN: I couldn\\'t either at first, but it\\'s true. I saw Master Windu attempt to assassinate the Chancellor myself.\\n\\nC-3PO leans over and whispers to ARTOO.\\n\\nC-3PO: Something important is going on! I heard a rumor they are going to banish all droids.\\n\\nARTOO BEEPS rather loudly. C-3PO puts his fingers to his lips.\\n\\nC-3PO: (continuing) Shhhhhh . . . not so loud.\\n\\nARTOO BEEPS quietly.\\n\\nC-3PO: (continuing) Whatever it is, we\\'ll be the last to know.\\n\\nPADME: Anakin, what are you going to do?\\n\\nANAKIN looks down for a moment and then walks away from Padme.\\n\\nANAKIN: I will not betray the Republic . . . my loyalties lie with the Chancellor and with the Senate . . . and with you.\\n\\nANAKIN turns and walks back to Padme.\\n\\nPADME: What about Obi-Wan?\\n\\nANAKIN: I don\\'t know . . . Many Jedi have been killed. We can only hope that he\\'s remained loyal to the Chancellor.\\n\\nPADME: How could this have happened?\\n\\nANAKIN: The Republic is unstable, Padme. The Jedi aren\\'t the only ones trying to take advantage of the situation. There are also traitors in the Senate.\\n\\nPADME stands and reacts ever so slightly.\\n\\nPADME: What are you saying?\\n\\nANAKIN: You need to distance yourself from your friends in the Senate. The Chancellor said they will be dealt with when this conflict is over.\\n\\nPADME: What if they start an inquisition? I\\'ve opposed this war. What will you do if I become a suspect?\\n\\nANAKIN: That won\\'t happen. I won\\'t let it.\\n\\nPADME: Oh, Anakin, I\\'m afraid.\\n\\nANAKIN takes PADME in his arms.\\n\\nANAKIN: Have faith, my love. Everything will soon be set right. The Chancellor has given me a very important mission. The Separatists have gathered in the Mustafar system. I\\'m going there to end this war. Wait for me until I return . . . things will be different, I promise.\\n\\nThey kiss.\\n\\nANAKIN: (continuing) Please, wait for me.\\n\\nPADME: I will.\\n\\nANAKIN gets into his Fighter as THREEPIO backs away.\\n\\nC-3PO: (to Artoo) Well, he is under a lot of stress, Artoo.\\n\\nARTOO beeps.\\n\\nC-3PO: (continuing) Take care, my little friend.\\n\\nARTOO BEEPS a good-bye, and the fighter takes off. PADME is left alone on the veranda. She starts to cry. THREEPIO comes up to her.\\n\\nC-3PO: (continuing) My Lady, is there anything I might do?\\n\\nPADME: No thank you, Threepio.\\n\\nG-3PO: A snack, perhaps?\\n\\nPADME: No.\\n\\nTHREEPIO starts to move off.\\n\\nC-3PO: I feel so helpless.\\n\\n163 EXT. ALDERAAN-STARCRUISER-SPACE\\n\\nOBI-WAN\\'s ship docks with Bail Organa\\'s Starcruiser.\\n\\n164 INT. ALDERAAN-STARCRUISER-HALLWAY-DAY\\n\\nThe door to the main hallway slides open. OBI-WAN enters and is greeted by YODA and BAIL ORGANA. The three walk down the hallway.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: You made it.\\n\\nYODA: Master Kenobi, dark times are these. Good to see you. it is.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: You were attacked by your Clones, also?\\n\\nYODA: With the help of the Wookiees, barely escape, I did.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: How many other Jedi managed to survive?\\n\\nYODA: Heard from no one, have we.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: I saw thousands of troops attack the Jedi Temple. That\\'s why I went looking for Yoda.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Have we had any contact from the Temple?\\n\\nYODA: Received a coded retreat message, we have.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: It requests all Jedi to return to the Temple. It says that the war is over . . .\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Well, then we must go back! If there are other stragglers, they will fall into the trap and be killed.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: It\\'s too dangerous to return.\\n\\nYODA: Suggest dismantling the coded signal, do you?\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Yes, Master. There is too much at stake here, and we need a clearer picture of what has happened.\\n\\nYODA: I agree. In a dark place we find ourselves ... a little more knowledge might light our way.\\n\\n165 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LAVA FIELDS-DAY\\n\\nWorkers move across the lava beds, gathering the magma. A column of aliens riding giant MUSTAFAR FLEAS marches forward.\\n\\n166 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY\\n\\nA HOLOGRAM of DARTH SIDIOUS is in the center of the room. NUTE GUNRAY and the REST OF THE SEPARATIST COALITION watch SIDIOUS.\\n\\nNUTE GUNRAY: The plan has gone as you had promised, My Lord.\\n\\nDARTH SIDIOUS: You have done well, Viceroy. When my new apprentice, Darth Vader, arrives, he will take care of you.\\n\\nThe hologram disappears.\\n\\n167 INT. CRUISER-COCKPIT\\n\\nThe Republic Cruiser heads toward Coruscant. OBI-WAN, BAIL, YODA, and TWO PILOTS sit in the cockpit.\\n\\nPILOT: We are receiving a message from the Chancellor\\'s office, sir.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: Send it through.\\n\\nPILOT: Yes, sir.\\n\\nThe PILOT pushes some buttons. MAS AMEDDA appears on screen.\\n\\nMAS AMEDDA: Senator Organa . . . the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic requests your presence at a special session of Congress.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: Tell the Chancellor I will be there.\\n\\nMAS AMEDDA: Very well. He will be expecting you.\\n\\nMAS AMEDDA\\'s image disappears from the screen.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: It could be a trap.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: No, I don\\'t think so. The Chancellor will not be able to control the thousands of star systems without keeping the Senate intact.\\n\\nYODA: If a special session of Congress there is, easier for us to enter the Jedi Temple it will be.\\n\\n168 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE LANDING PLATFORM-LATE DAY\\n\\nOBI-WAN, BAIL, and YODA land on Coruscant. The elevator door opens, and they step out.\\n\\nGUARD: Welcome back, Senator. May I see your clearance?\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: Certainly.\\n\\nGUARD: Thank you, you may proceed. We will take custody of the Jedi.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: It would be better if we stayed with the Senator.\\n\\nGUARD: It would be better if they stayed with you.\\n\\nBAIL and his AIDES go into the Senate.

MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY\\n\\nANAKIN, putting on his hood, walks across a walkway upon arriving on Mustafar.\\n\\n172 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY\\n\\nANAKIN appears in the doorway of the control center.\\n\\nNUTE GUNRAY: Welcome, Lord Vader.

Suddenly there is a flash of a lightsaber, a flurry of confusion, and all of the Clone Troopers are dead on the floor. YODA and OBI-WAN stand in the middle of the carnage.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: There are several battalions of Clone Troopers on every level. Many are dressed as Jedi.\\n\\nYODA: Dismantle the coded signal quickly. That group back there, soon discovered will be.\\n\\n175 EXT.

By a lightsaber, he was.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: . . .Who?? Who could have done this?\\n\\n178 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY\\n\\nANAKIN ignites his lightsaber, NUTE and the OTHERS panic. The DROIDS at the controls and the GUARDS grab their weapons, but it is too late. They are cut down in a flash. The Separatists bang on the doors, and NUTE and RUNE HAAKO flee under a table.\\n\\nANAKIN, stone-faced, moves through the room like the grim reaper. Bodies drop everywhere. SCREAMS are cut short as the head of the Banking Clan dies.\\n\\nThen POGGLE THE LESSER loses his head; WAT TAMBOR, SHU MAI, and the REST OF THE SEPARATISTS run into the conference room.\\n\\n179 INT.

CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMBER-SUNSET\\n\\nPALPATINE continues his speech at the podium.\\n\\nPALPATINE: The war is over. (applause) The Separatists have been defeated, (applause) and the Jedi rebellion has been foiled. We stand on the threshold of a new beginning.\\n\\nThere is a long period of APPLAUSE.\\n\\nPADME: Well, this is the moment we discover if he intends to return the Republic to a democracy.\\n\\nPALPATINE: In order to ensure our security and continuing stability, the Republic will be reorganized into the first Galactic Empire, for a safe and secure society which I assure you will last for ten thousand years.\\n\\nThere is a loud, sustained CHEER from the Senate. BAIL ORGANA and PADME sit, dumbfounded.\\n\\nPALPATINE: (continuing) An empire that will continue to be ruled by this august body, and a sovereign ruler chosen for life . . .\\n\\nThe Senate CHEERS again.

PADME stops him.\\n\\nPADME: Not now! There will be a time.\\n\\n182 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-CONFERENCE ROOM-DAY\\n\\nAfter everyone in the Main Control Room is dead, ANAKIN moves to the small conference room where WAT TAMBOR. SHU MAI, and some OTHER SEPARATISTS are hiding. RUNE HAAKO tries to run but is trapped by a dead-end as ANAKIN advances.\\n\\nRUNE HAAKO: Stop! Enough, this is not right!\\n\\nRUNE is cut down. NUTE GUNRAY crawls out from under the table and opens the Main Door, allowing DESTROYER DROIDS to enter. WAT TAMBOR is cut down, along with SHU MAI. DESTROYER DROIDS appear in the doorway and blast away, causing total destruction. When the firing is over, ANAKIN is gone. Blown away? No. ANAKIN drops from the ceiling behind the TWO DROIDS and cuts them to pieces before they know what hit them.\\n\\n183 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-HALLWAY-DAY\\n\\nNUTE GUNRAY is the last Separatist leader alive. ANAKIN moves on to find NUTE GUNRAY hiding in an alcove.\\n\\nNUTE GUNRAY: The war is over.

CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-COMPUTER ROOM-NIGHT\\n\\nOBI-WAN stands in a large computer area as YODA looks on, in the hatchway to the Main Control Center.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I\\'ve recalibrated the code warning all surviving Jedi to stay away.\\n\\nYODA: Good . . .

CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-CONTROL CENTER-NIGHT\\n\\nOBI-WAN enters the Main Control Center with YODA and heads for the hologram area.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Wait, Master.

Do you feel your power growing?\\n\\nANAKIN: Yes, My Master.\\n\\nDARTH SlDIOUS: Now, Lord Vader, now go and bring peace to the Empire.\\n\\nOBI-WAN watches in horror. Tears well up in his eyes.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I can\\'t watch any more.\\n\\nOBI-WAN switches off the hologram. The TWO JEDI stand in silence for a few moments.\\n\\nYODA: Destroy the Sith, we must.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Send me to kill the Emperor. I will not kill Anakin.\\n\\nYODA: To fight this Lord Sidious, strong enough, you are not.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: He is like my brother ... I cannot do it.\\n\\nYODA: Twisted by the dark side, young Skywalker has become. The boy you trained, gone he is . . . Consumed by Darth Vader.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: How could it have come to this?\\n\\nYODA: To question, no time there is.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I do not know where the Emperor has sent him. I don\\'t know where to look.\\n\\nYODA: Use your feelings, Obi-Wan, and find him, you will. Visit the new Emperor, my task is.

CORUSCANT -PADME\\'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-AFTERNOON\\n\\nThe cockpit of the sleek yellow Galactic Speeder opens, and a HOODED FIGURE emerges and walks onto the veranda. An ALARM GOES OFF deep in the apartment. The FIGURE stops before a security curtain that protects the veranda. C-3PO enters the veranda and approaches the FIGURE.\\n\\nC-3PO: Hello, might I help you . . . Oh, it\\'s you, Master Kenobi. Come in, quickly.\\n\\nThe security curtain disappears, and the FIGURE lifts his hood. It is OBI-WAN. The alarm stops sounding.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Has Anakin been here . . . ?\\n\\nC-3PO: Yes . . . right after the attack on the Jedi Temple.\\n\\nPADME comes down the stairs in a robe. THREEPIO leaves.\\n\\nPADME: Master Kenobi . . .\\n\\nShe embraces Obi-Wan.\\n\\nPADME: (continuing) Oh, Obi-Wan, thank goodness . . . you\\'re alive.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: The Republic has fallen. Padme . . . The Jedi Order is no more . . .\\n\\nPADME: I know, it\\'s hard to believe everything to which we\\'ve dedicated our lives is gone.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I believe we have been part of a plot hundreds of years in the making.\\n\\nPADME: The Senate is still intact, there is some hope.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: No. Padme . . . It\\'s over . . . The Sith now rule the galaxy as they did before the Republic.\\n\\nPADME: The Sith!?!\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I\\'m here looking for Anakin . . . When was the last time you saw him?\\n\\nPADME: Yesterday.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: And do you know where he is now?\\n\\nPADME: (looks down) No.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Padme, I need your help. He\\'s in grave danger.\\n\\nPADME: From the Sith?\\n\\nOBI-WAN: From himself . . . Padme, Anakin has turned to the dark side.\\n\\nPADME: You\\'re wrong! How could you even say that?\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I have seen a security hologram of him killing younglings.\\n\\nPADME: Not Anakin! He couldn\\'t!\\n\\nOBI-WAN: He was deceived by a lie. We all were. It appears that the Chancellor is behind everything, including the war. Palpatine is the Sith Lord we\\'ve been looking for. After the death of Count Dooku, Anakin became his new apprentice.\\n\\nPADME: I don\\'t believe you ... I can\\'t.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Padme, I must find him.\\n\\nPADME: You\\'re going to kill him, aren\\'t you?\\n\\nOBI-WAN: He has become a very great threat.\\n\\nAs PADME moves to sit down, she reveals her pregnancy.\\n\\nPADME: I can\\'t . . .\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Anakin is the father, isn\\'t he?\\n\\nPADME looks away.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) I\\'m so sorry.\\n\\nOBI-WAN turns and leaves as PADME stares transfixed, not knowing what to do.

CORUSCANT-LANDING PLATFORM-SUNSET\\n\\nA small Naboo Skiff rests on a landing platform in the vast congestion of Coruscant. PADME gets out of her Speeder, followed by CAPTAIN TYPHO and C-3PO.\\n\\nCAPTAIN TYPHO: My Lady, let me come with you.\\n\\nPADME: There is no danger. The fighting is over, and . . . this is personal.\\n\\nTYPHO bows.\\n\\nCAPTAIN TYPHO: As you wish, My Lady . . . but I strongly disagree.\\n\\nPADME: I\\'ll be all right, Captain.\\n\\nHe goes to the speeder and gets in.\\n\\nPADME: (continuing) This is something I must do myself. Besides, Threepio will look after me.\\n\\nC-3PO: Oh, dear.\\n\\nTYPHO takes off and PADME and THREEPIO board the small NABOO SKIFF. A shadow moves out from under the SKIFF. It is OBI-WAN. He quickly jumps on the retracting ramp as the SKIFF takes off.\\n\\n192 INT. NABOO SKIFF\\n\\nTHREEPIO chatters away as PADME breaks down in tears, the painful reality sinking in.\\n\\nC-3PO: Green light. Do you know that I think I\\'m beginning to get the hang of this flying business.\\n\\nOBI-WAN stows away on Padme\\'s ship.

MUSTAFAR-COXFERENCE ROOM-DAY\\n\\nA Hologram of Sidious speaks with Anakin in the Mustafar control room.\\n\\nDARTH SlDIOUS: Send a message to the ships of the Trade Federation. Tell them the Separatist leaders have been wiped out. Grievous and Dooku have been destroyed. All droid units must shut down immediately.\\n\\nDARTH VADER: Very good, My Lord.\\n\\nANAKIN sees Padme\\'s ship arriving on the screen and goes out to meet her.\\n\\n195 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY\\n\\nThe sleek NABOO SKIFF lands on the Mustafar landing platform near Anakin\\'s GREEN STARFIGHTER. ANAKIN runs up to the SKIFF as the ramp lowers. PADME runs to him.\\n\\nANAKIN: Padme, I saw your ship . . .\\n\\nThey embrace.\\n\\nPADME: Oh, Anakin!\\n\\nANAKIN: It\\'s all right, you\\'re safe now. What are you doing out here?\\n\\nPADME: I was so worried about you. Obi-Wan told me terrible things.\\n\\nANAKIN: What things?\\n\\nPADME: He said you have turned to the dark side . . . that you killed younglings.\\n\\nANAKIN: Obi-Wan is trying to turn you against me.\\n\\nPADME: He cares about us.\\n\\nANAKIN: Us??!\\n\\nPADME: He knows . . . He wants to help you.\\n\\nANAKIN: Is Obi-Wan going to protect you? He can\\'t ... he can\\'t help you. He\\'s not strong enough.\\n\\nPADME: Anakin, all I want is your love.\\n\\nANAKIN: Love won\\'t save you, Padme. Only my new powers can do that.\\n\\nPADME: At what cost? You are a good person. Don\\'t do this.\\n\\nANAKIN: I won\\'t lose you the way I lost my mother! I\\'ve become more powerful than any Jedi has ever dreamed of and I\\'ve done it for you. To protect you.\\n\\nPADME: Come away with me. Help me raise our child. Leave everything else behind while we still can.\\n\\nANAKIN: Don\\'t you see, we don\\'t have to run away anymore. I have brought peace to the Republic. I am more powerful than the Chancellor. I can overthrow him, and together you and I can rule the galaxy. Make things the way we want them to be.\\n\\nPADME: I don\\'t believe what I\\'m hearing . . . Obi-Wan was right. You\\'ve changed.\\n\\nANAKIN: I don\\'t want to hear any more about Obi-Wan. The Jedi turned against me. Don\\'t you turn against me.\\n\\nPADME: I don\\'t know you anymore. Anakin, you\\'re breaking my heart. I\\'ll never stop loving you, but you are going down a path I\\ncan\\'t follow.\\n\\nANAKIN: Because of Obi-Wan?\\n\\nPADME: Because of what you\\'ve done . . . what you plan to do. Stop, stop now. Come back! I love you.\\n\\nANAKIN: (seeing Obi-Wan) Liar!\\n\\nPADME turns around and. sees OBI-WAN standing in the doorway of the Naboo Cruiser.\\n\\nPADME: No!\\n\\nANAKIN: You\\'re with him. You\\'ve betrayed me! You brought him here to kill me!\\n\\nPADME: NO! Anakin. I swear ... I ...\\n\\nANAKIN reaches out, and PADME grabs her throat as she starts to choke.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Let her go, Anakin.\\n\\nANAKIN: What have you and she been up to?\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Let her go!\\n\\nANAKIN releases his grip on the unconscious PADME and she crumples to the ground.\\n\\nANAKIN: You turned her against me.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: You have done that yourself.\\n\\nANAKIN: You will not take her from me.\\n\\nANAKIN throws off his cloak.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Your anger and your lust for power have already done that.\\n\\nOBI-WAN flings off his cloak.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) You have allowed this Dark Lord to twist your mind until now . . . until now you have become the very thing you swore to destroy.\\n\\nThey circle each other until OBI-WAN is near PADME. He places his hand on her.\\n\\nANAKIN: Don\\'t lecture me, Obi-Wan. I see through the lies of the Jedi. I do not fear the dark side as you do. I have brought peace, justice, freedom, and security to my new Empire.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Your new Empire?\\n\\nANAKIN: Don\\'t make me kill you.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Anakin, my allegiance is to the Republic ... to democracy.\\n\\nANAKIN: If you\\'re not with me, you\\'re my enemy.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Only a Sith Lord deals in absolutes. I will do what I must.\\n\\n(ignites his lightsaber)\\n\\nANAKIN: You will try.\\n\\nANAKIN ignites his lightsaber.\\n\\nANAKIN lashes out at OBI-WAN, and they begin a ferocious sword fight.

At last, the Jedi are no more.\\n\\nYODA: Not if anything I have to say about it, Lord Sidious.\\n\\nYODA uses the Force to throw DARTH SIDIOUS back, knocking him clear over his desk and onto the floor in a heap.\\n\\nYODA: (continuing) At an end your rule is and not short enough it was, I must say.\\n\\nDARTH SIDIOUS flies through the air, cape flapping, heading toward the exit. At the last second, YODA flies into the exit and stops the Dark Lord.\\n\\nYODA: (continuing) If so powerful you are, why leave??\\n\\nYODA ignites his lightsaber.\\n\\nDARTH SlDIOUS: You will not stop me. Darth Vader will become more powerful than either of us.\\n\\nDARTH SIDIOUS ignites his lightsaber.\\n\\nYODA: Faith in your new apprentice, misplaced may be, as is your faith in the dark side of the Force.\\n\\nTheir swords CLASH.

Failed, I have.\\n\\nYODA and BAIL fly into the traffic of the city.\\n\\n212 EXT. MUSTAFAR-COLLECTION PANELS-DAY\\n\\nOBI-WAN realizes he is getting very close to the edge of the lava falls. He grabs a rope and leaps from the collection arm. ANAKIN follows.\\nANAKIN and OBI-WAN continue their sword fight hanging from cables as they swing past each other.\\n\\n213 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-NABOO SKIFF-DAY\\n\\nC-3PO carefully lifts PADME into his arms. R2-D2 nervously looks on. BEEPING.\\n\\nC-3PO: I am being careful. I\\'ve got a good hold on her, but . . . I\\'m worried about my back. I hope it\\'s able to hold up under this weight.\\n\\nC-3PO carries PADME into the Naboo Skiff.\\n\\n214 EXT. MUSTAFAR-COLLECTION PANELS-DAY\\n\\nFrom their cables, ANAKIN and OBI-WAN both spot something that causes them to stop fighting. The lava river ahead drops off in a tremendous lava fall.\\n\\nSNAPPING AND METAL GROANS are heard as the main part of the collector starts to break away and move toward the lava fall. OBI-WAN looks around and sees a small floating platform making its way toward the tower.\\n\\nOBI-WAN does a double hack-flip and lands squarely on the floating platform. He immediately leans to one side and moves away from the tower.\\n\\nANAKIN realizes he is doomed as the entire tower heads for the falls. In the distance he sees some CONSTRUCTION DROIDS. He swings back to the tower, climbs up and makes a running leap and miraculously lands on A WORKER DROID. The DROID is confused and chatters to his CO-WORKER. The giant collector goes over the lava flow and disappears in the mist of sparks below.\\n\\nOBI-WAN heads for the bank of the lava river, but Anakin\\'s DROID is faster. He catches up with his old Master.\\n\\nOBI-WAN and ANAKIN continue the swordfight. They battle away, balancing on the tiny platform and puzzled DROID. ANAKIN, standing on the Droid, approaches OBI-WAN on the work platform.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I have failed you, Anakin. I was never able to teach you to think.\\n\\nANAKIN and OBI-WAN confront each other on the lava river.\\n\\nANAKIN: I should have known the Jedi were plotting to take over . . .\\n\\nOBI-WAN: From the Sith!!! Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil.\\n\\nANAKIN: From the Jedi point of view! From my point of view, the Jedi are evil.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Well, then you are lost!\\n\\nANAKIN: This is the end for you, My Master. I wish it were otherwise.\\n\\nANAKIN jumps and flips onto OBI- WAN\\'s platform. The fighting continues again until OBI-WAN jumps toward the safety of the black sandy edge of the lava river. He yells at Anakin.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: It\\'s over, Anakin. I have the high ground.\\n\\nANAKIN: You underestimate my power!\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Don\\'t try it.\\n\\nANAKIN follows, and OBI-WAN cuts his young apprentice at the knees, then cuts off his left arm in the blink of an eye. ANAKIN tumbles down the embankment and rolls to a stop near the edge of the lava.\\n\\nANAKIN struggles to pull himself up the embankment with his mechanical hand. His thin leather glove has been burned off. He keeps sliding down in the black sand.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) . . . You were the Chosen One! It was said that you would, destroy the Sith, not join them. It was you who would bring balance to the Force, not leave it in Darkness.\\n\\nOBI-WAN picks up Anakin\\'s light saber and begins to walk away. He stops and looks back.\\n\\nANAKIN: I hate you!\\n\\nOBI-WAN: You were my brother, Anakin. I loved you.\\n\\nANAKIN\\'S clothing blows into the lava river and ignites. Suddenly ANAKIN bursts into flames and starts SCREAMING.\\n\\n215 INT. MUSTAFAR-VOLCANO EDGE-DAY\\n\\nOBI-WAN looks in horror as ANAKIN becomes engulfed in flames. OBI-WAN can\\'t watch him as he struggles to climb the embankment, covered in flames.\\n\\nHe runs back to Padme\\'s ship as ANAKIN drops, smoldering, near the top of the lava pit.\\n\\n216 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-NABOO SKIFF-DAY\\n\\nOBI-WAN makes his way to the SKIFF. He looks for Padme. THREEPIO sticks his head out the door of the SKIFF.\\n\\nC-3PO: Master Kenobi! We have Miss Padme on board. Please, please hurry. We should leave this dreadful place.\\n\\nOBI-WAN runs on board the Naboo Skiff.\\n\\n217 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-NABOO SKIFF-DAY\\n\\nPADME lies on a cot or bed inside the ship. OBI-WAN walks over and checks on her.\\n\\nPADME: Obi-Wan? Is Anakin all right?\\n\\nOBI-WAN looks at her sadly and does not answer. He brushes her hair back. Padme drops back into unconsciousness. ARTOO watches over her.\\nOBI-WAN rides in the co-pilot\\'s station. He sits looking pensive. THREEPIO drives.\\n\\n218 EXT. MUSTAFAR-VOLCANO EDGE-DAY\\n\\nANAKIN crawls up the bank, his body smoking. A shuttle flies overhead and lands.\\n\\n219 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-IMPERIAL SHUTTLE-DAY\\n\\nAn Imperial Shuttle closes its wings and settles on the highest of the Mustafar Landing Platforms. A PLATOON OF CLONE TROOPERS exits the craft, followed by DARTH SIDIOUS.\\n\\n220 INT. MUSTAFAR-VOLCANO PIT-DAY\\n\\nDARTH SIDIOUS walks in front of the CLONE TROOPERS on his way to get to Anakin at the edge of the lava pit.\\n\\n221 EXT. MUSTAFAR-VOLCANO PIT-DAY\\n\\nDARTH SIDIOUS discovers what remains of ANAKIN and checks him out. He turns to the CLONES.\\n\\nDARTH SIDIOUS: Anakin! Anakin! There he is. He\\'s still alive. Get a medical capsule, immediately.\\n\\nCLONE CAPTAIN: Yes sir. Right away.\\n\\nSeveral of the CLONES rush off as DARTH SIDlOUS puts his hand on ANAKIN\\'s forehead.\\n\\n222 INT. POLIS MASSA-OBSERVATION DOME-NIGHT\\n\\nOn the isolated asteroid of Polis Massa, YODA meditates.\\n\\nYODA: Failed to stop the Sith Lord, I have. Still much to learn, there is ...\\n\\nQUI -GON: (V.O.) Patience. You will have time. I did not. When I became one with the Force I made a great discovery. With my training, you will be able to merge with the Force at will. Your physical self will fade away, but you will still retain your consciousness. You will become more powerful than any Sith.\\n\\nYODA: Eternal consciousness.\\n\\nQUI-GON: (V.O.) The ability to defy oblivion can be achieved, but only for oneself. It was accomplished by a Shaman of the Whills. It is a state acquired through compassion, not greed.\\n\\nYODA: . . . to become one with the Force, and influence still have . . . A power greater than all, it is.\\n\\nQUI-GON: (V.O.) You will learn to let go of everything. No attachment, no thought of self. No physical self.\\n\\nYODA: A great Jedi Master, you have become, Qui-Gon Jinn. Your apprentice I gratefully become.\\n\\nYODA thinks about this for a minute, then BAIL ORGANA enters the room and breaks his meditation.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: Excuse me, Master Yoda. Obi-Wan Kenobi has made contact.\\n\\n223 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY\\n\\nThe CLONES have placed ANAKIN in a medical capsule. They float the wounded Sith Lord into the belly of the IMPERIAL CRUISER. DARTH SIDIOUS follows the capsule into the ship. The ship takes off.\\n\\n224 EXT. POLIS MASSA-LANDING PLATFORM-NIGHT\\n\\nOBI-WAN lands the Naboo Cruiser on the landing platform of the isolated post of Polis Massa. YODA and BAIL ORGANA, along with a FEW GROUND CREW, are waiting as the ramp lowers and OBI-WAN emerges, carrying the unconscious PADME in his arms, followed by ARTOO and THREEPIO.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: We\\'ll take her to the medical center, quickly.\\n\\n225 EXT. LANDING PLATFORM-CORUSCANT-IMPERIAL REHAB CENTER-DAY\\n\\nThe shuttle lands. DARTH SIDIOUS and CLONE TROOPERS leave the shuttle. ANAKIN\\'s body is carried along in a floating medical capsule.\\n\\n226 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-NIGHT\\n\\nPOLIS MEDICS work, on PADME in an operating theater. OBI-WAN and one of the MEDICAL DROIDS enter an observation room where BAIL and YODA are waiting.\\n\\nMEDICAL DROID: Medically, she is completely healthy. For reasons we can\\'t explain, we are losing her.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: She\\'s dying?\\n\\nMEDICAL DROID: We don\\'t know why. She has lost the will to live. We need to operate quickly if we are to save the babies.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: Babies??!!\\n\\nMEDICAL DROID: She\\'s carrying twins.\\n\\nYODA: Save them, we must. They are our last hope.\\n\\nThe MEDICAL DROID rushes back to the operating room. ARTOO and THREEPIO watch, greatly puzzled. ARTOO BEEPS.\\n\\nC-3PO: It s some kind of reproductive process, I think.\\n\\n227 INT. CORUSCANT-IMPERIAL REHAB CENTER-DAY\\n\\nANAKIN, in the medical capsule, is lifted onto a table in the Rehab Center. DROIDS go to work on him. ANAKIN has new legs and a new arm.\\n\\n228 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-NIGHT\\n\\nThe TWINS are being delivered as BAIL ORGANA, YODA, ARTOO, and THREEPIO watch. OBI-WAN is in the operating theater with PADME. He takes her hand.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Don\\'t give up, Padme.\\n\\nPADME winces from the pain. The MEDICAL DROID is holding the BABY.\\n\\nMEDICAL DROID: It\\'s a boy.\\n\\nPADME: Luke . . .\\n\\nPADME can only offer up a faint smile. She struggles to touch the baby on the forehead.\\n\\nMEDICAL DROID: ... and a girl.\\n\\nPADME: . . . Leia.\\n\\nR2-D2, THREEPIO and BAIL ORGANA watch from an adjoining space.\\n\\n229 INT. CORUSCANT-IMPERIAL REHAB CENTER-DAY\\n\\nVADER, dressed in his black body armor, lies on the table. Nose plugs are inserted and the mask drops from above, sealing tightly. The helmet is fitted and VADER begins breathing.\\n\\n230 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-NIGHT\\n\\nOBI WAN leans over PADME and softly speaks to her.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: You have twins, Padme They need you . . . hang on.\\n\\nPADME: I can\\'t . . .\\n\\nPADME winces again and takes OBI-WAN\\'s hand. She is holding Anakin\\'s japor snippet.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Save your energy.\\n\\nPADME: Obi-Wan . . . there . . . is good in him. I know there is ... still . . .\\n\\nA last gasp, and she dies. Obi-Wan studies the necklace.\\n\\n231 INT. CORUSCANT-IMPERIAL REHAB CENTER-DAY\\n\\nDARTH SIDIOUS hovers around the periphery of a group of MEDICAL DROIDS who are working on ANAKIN. DARTH SIDIOUS paces in the foreground. A DROID approaches the Dark Lord.\\n\\nMEDICAL DROID: My Lord, the construction is finished ... he lives.\\n\\nDARTH SIDIOUS: Good. Good.\\n\\nThe DROID moves back to the table where DARTH VADER lies. The table begins to move upright. DARTH SIDIOUS moves in next to DARTH VADER.\\n\\nDARTH SIDIOUS: (continuing) Lord Vader, can you hear me?\\n\\nDARTH VADER, with his dark mask and helmet, moves up into the frame until he is in a CLOSEUP.\\n\\nDARTH VADER: Yes, My Master.\\n\\nDARTH VADER looks around the room.\\n\\nDARTH VADER: (continuing) Where is Padme? Is she safe, is she all right?\\n\\nDARTH SIDIOUS moves closer to the half droid/half man.\\n\\nDARTH SIDIOUS: I\\'m afraid she died. ... it seems in your anger, you killed her.\\n\\nA LOW GROAN emanates from Vader\\'s mask. Suddenly everything in the room begins to implode, including some of the DROIDS.\\n\\nDARTH VADER: I couldn\\'t have! She was alive! I felt her! She was alive! It\\'s impossible! No!!!\\n\\nVADER SCREAMS, breaks his bonds to the table, and steps forward, waving his hands, causing objects to fly around the room. SIDIOUS deflects the objects, but some of the DROIDS aren\\'t so lucky. VADER\\'S PAINFUL SCREAMS echo throughout the Center.\\n\\n232 EXT. NABOO-ALDERAAN STARCRUISER\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA\\'s Starcruiser approaches the city of Theed.\\n\\n233 INT. ALDERAAN CRUISER-CONFERENCE ROOM\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA, YODA, and OBI-WAN sit around a conference table.\\n\\nYODA: Pregnant, she must still appear. Hidden, safe, the children must be kept.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: We must take them somewhere the Sith will not sense their presence.\\n\\nYODA: Split up, they should be.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: My wife and I will take the girl. We\\'ve always talked of adopting a baby girl. She will be loved with us.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: And what of the boy?\\n\\nYODA: To Tatooine. To his family, send him.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I will take the child and watch over him. Master Yoda, do you think Anakin\\'s twins will be able to defeat Darth Sidious?\\n\\nYODA: Strong the Force runs, in the Skywalker line. Hope, we can . . . Done, it is. Until the time is right, disappear we will.\\n\\nBAIL leaves the conference room. YODA stops OBI-WAN.\\n\\nYODA: (continuing) Master Kenobi, wait a moment. In your solitude on Tatooine, training I have for you.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Training??\\n\\nYODA: An old friend has learned the path to immortality.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Who?\\n\\nYODA: One who has returned from the netherworld of the Force to train me . . . your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: Qui-Gon? But, how could he accomplish this?\\n\\nYODA: The secret of the Ancient Order of the Whills, he studied. How to commune with him. I will teach you.\\n\\nOBI-WAN: I will be able to talk with him?\\n\\nYODA: How to join the Force, he will train you. Your consciousness you will retain, when one with the Force. Even your physical self, perhaps.\\n\\n234 INT. ALDERAAN STARCRUISER-HALLWAY- SPACE\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA, followed by ARTOO and THREEPIO, approaches CAPTAIN ANTILLES and TWO CREW MEMBERS.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: Captain Antilles.\\n\\nCAPTAIN ANTILLES: Yes, Your Highness.\\n\\nBAIL ORGANA: I\\'m placing these droids in your care. Treat them well. Clean them up. Have the Protocol Droid\\'s mind wiped.\\n\\nC-3PO: Oh, no.\\n\\n235 EXT.

IMPERIAL STAR DESTROYER-SPACE\\n\\nA Star Destroyer is surrounded by ATTACK CRUISERS. On the bridge of the Star Destroyer stands the EMPEROR and GOVERNOR\\nTARKIN.\\n\\nDARTH VADER walks along the bridge to join the EMPEROR and GOVERNOR TARKIN.

ALDERAAN-LATE AFTERNOON\\n\\nThe QUEEN OF ALDERAAN sits on a balcony looking out over the awesome mountains of Alderaan. BAIL ORGANA brings a small baby to her. She takes her and rocks her.\\n\\n240 EXT. TATOOINE-SUNSET\\n\\nOBI-WAN rides up to the moisture farm homestead on an EOPIE. He dismounts, takes the BABY out of a papoose on his back, and walks toward AUNT BERU, who walks over to greet him. They talk for a moment, and OBI-WAN turns the baby over to the young homesteader. AUNT BERU walks to UNCLE OWEN who is standing on the ridge near the homestead. OBI-WAN leaves as OWEN, BERU, and the BABY watch the twin suns set.\\n\\nIRIS OUT. END TITLES.\\n\\n'"
